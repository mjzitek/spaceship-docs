## Important Reminders

1. **Maintain Your Records**: Warranty claims require proof of maintenance
2. **Use Genuine Parts**: Aftermarket parts void warranty
3. **Follow Procedures**: Improper operation voids coverage
4. **Register Your Vessel**: Updates and recalls sent to registered owners only
5. **Read Your Manual**: Most issues can be prevented with proper use and maintenance
6. **Don't Defer Maintenance**: "I'll do it next month" often becomes "I need warranty repair"
7. **Ask Questions**: Support line available to help - prevention better than repair
