# Emergency Procedure: Hull Breach and Rapid Decompression

**Document ID:** EMERG-010
**Revision:** 3.1
**Last Updated:** 2847.09.14
**Manufacturer:** Outer Rim Starship Manufacturing

## Scope

This procedure covers immediate response to hull breaches causing rapid or gradual decompression. All crew members must be familiar with this procedure.

## Danger Assessment

**Immediate Threats**:
- Loss of breathable atmosphere (hypoxia in minutes)
- Explosive decompression injuries
- Objects/crew sucked toward breach
- Rapid pressure drop causes ear/lung damage
- Temperature drop (space is near absolute zero)

**Time Critical**: Crew has 15-30 seconds of useful consciousness in vacuum.

## Warning Signs

**Audible Warnings**:
- Loud hissing or roaring sound
- HIMS alarm: "HULL BREACH DETECTED"
- Pressure alarm klaxon

**Physical Sensations**:
- Ears popping painfully
- Difficulty breathing
- Wind/air current toward breach
- Rapid temperature drop
- Floating objects accelerating toward breach

**Visual Indicators**:
- Mist forming in air (moisture condensing)
- Hull breach location display on terminals
- Pressure gauge dropping
- Red warning lights

## Immediate Actions (First 30 Seconds)

### For Crew in Breached Compartment

**DO IMMEDIATELY**:

1. **Grab nearest support** - Prevent being sucked toward breach
2. **Hold breath and EXHALE** - Do not hold breath during decompression (lung rupture risk)
3. **Protect eyes** - Close or cover if possible
4. **Move toward exit** - Get to adjacent compartment if possible
5. **If caught in breach stream** - Grab anything secured, work sideways out of flow

**DO NOT**:
- Do not try to breathe normally (no air available)
- Do not hold full breath (will rupture lungs as pressure drops)
- Do not try to patch breach yourself (evacuate first)

### For Crew in Other Compartments

**DO IMMEDIATELY**:

1. **Seal bulkhead doors** - Prevent pressure loss spreading
2. **Don emergency respirator** - Prepare for pressure drop
3. **Secure loose objects** - Prevent projectiles
4. **Check pressure indicators** - Confirm your section holding pressure
5. **Prepare for rescue** - Once sealed, assist trapped crew if any

## Emergency Response Sequence

### Phase 1: Immediate Survival (0-60 seconds)

**Step 1: Automatic Response** (computer executes):
- HIMS detects breach (T+0 seconds)
- Alarms sound throughout vessel (T+1 second)
- Affected compartment identified on displays (T+2 seconds)
- Automated bulkhead seals close (T+2-5 seconds)
- Emergency beacon activates (T+5 seconds)

**Step 2: Crew Evacuation**:
- All crew in breached compartment evacuate immediately
- Do not stop to retrieve possessions
- Help injured crew if time permits
- Last person out closes manual override on bulkhead (backup to automatic)

**Step 3: Headcount**:
- Account for all crew
- Identify anyone trapped in breached section
- Assess injuries

### Phase 2: Damage Assessment (1-5 minutes)

**Step 1: Confirm Containment**:
- Verify bulkhead seals holding
- Check pressure stable in safe compartments
- Monitor air supply levels
- Calculate remaining breathable air

**Step 2: Locate Breach**:
- HIMS will display approximate location
- Use internal cameras if available
- Acoustic sensors triangulate position
- Visual inspection from safe areas

**Step 3: Assess Severity**:
- Small breach (<5 cm): Pressure loss slow, hours of air remaining
- Medium breach (5-20 cm): Moderate loss, repair within 1-2 hours needed
- Large breach (>20 cm): Rapid loss, emergency repairs immediately or evacuate vessel
- Catastrophic (>1 meter): Consider abandon ship

**Step 4: Check for Additional Damage**:
- Are there multiple breaches?
- Is hull structure compromised?
- Other systems damaged (power, propulsion, life support)?
- Can vessel maintain integrity?

### Phase 3: Breach Containment (5-30 minutes)

**Option A: Seal Compartment** (recommended if breach large):

1. Confirm bulkhead seals engaged
2. Verify no crew trapped in breached section
3. Depressurize breached compartment completely (vent to space)
4. Removes air rush, stabilizes remaining sections
5. Plan for EVA repair or temporary abandonment of section

**Option B: Emergency Patch** (if breach small, crew not in immediate danger):

1. Gather emergency patch supplies:
   - Foam sealant (Part #: SEAL-FOAM-100)
   - Patch plates (various sizes)
   - Magnetic or adhesive mounts
   - Protective gear (pressure suit or respirator)

2. Approach breach carefully:
   - Tether yourself to secure point
   - Work from side, not in front of breach
   - Expect strong air current

3. Apply foam sealant:
   - Spray directly into breach opening
   - Foam expands and hardens in ~30 seconds
   - Creates temporary pressure seal
   - Reduces air loss immediately

4. Apply patch plate:
   - Select plate larger than breach
   - Position over foam-sealed breach
   - Engage magnetic or adhesive mount
   - Provides structural support to foam

5. Monitor pressure:
   - Watch for pressure stabilization
   - Listen for continued leaking
   - Apply additional sealant if needed

**Option C: EVA External Repair** (if internal access impossible):

1. Don EVA suit
2. Exit through airlock
3. Maneuver to breach location on exterior hull
4. Apply patch from outside:
   - Better structural support
   - Can cover larger breaches
   - May weld or bolt patch in place
5. Re-enter and monitor seal

### Phase 4: Stabilization (30+ minutes)

**Step 1: Verify Repairs Holding**:
- Monitor pressure levels (should stabilize)
- Check patch visually and with sensors
- Listen for air leaks
- Thermal imaging shows cold spots if still leaking

**Step 2: Assess Air Supply**:
- Calculate remaining breathable air
- Factor in crew size and consumption
- Emergency oxygen tanks add 6-24 hours typically
- Determine if sufficient to reach port

**Step 3: Restore Systems**:
- Repressurize sealed sections if safe
- Restart life support systems
- Check hull structural integrity
- Test propulsion systems

**Step 4: Plan Next Actions**:
- Can vessel reach port safely?
- Is permanent repair needed immediately?
- Should distress signal be sent?
- Can cargo/operations continue?

## Special Situations

### Crew Trapped in Breached Compartment

**If crew cannot evacuate before seal**:

1. Assess crew status:
   - In pressure suits? (Can survive in vacuum)
   - Access to emergency air? (Time limited)
   - Injured or unconscious? (Critical situation)

2. Calculate rescue time:
   - How long can they survive with available resources?
   - How long to patch breach or repressurize?
   - Is rescue possible before air runs out?

3. Rescue options:
   - **Option A**: Rapid patch of breach, repressurize compartment
   - **Option B**: Deliver pressure suits/air through temporary airlock
   - **Option C**: Cut through bulkhead wall (extreme measure, compromises seal)
   - **Option D**: EVA rescue (bring crew out through external hull breach)

4. Communication:
   - Use intercom if functional
   - Hand signals through viewport
   - Text via portable terminals

**Priority is saving crew life, even if risks vessel**

### Breach During FTL Transit

**CRITICAL DANGER**: FTL field requires hull integrity

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Emergency FTL abort (hit "FTL ABORT" button)
2. Expect rough drop-out from quantum tunnel
3. Spatial position will be uncertain (may be off course)
4. Follow standard breach procedures once in normal space
5. DO NOT attempt FTL jump again until breach fully repaired and inspected

**See EMERG-006 for FTL emergency procedures**

### Breach in Critical Location

**If breach in vital area**:

**Bridge Breach**:
- Evacuate bridge if necessary
- Transfer control to auxiliary control (engineering)
- Can operate vessel remotely

**Engineering/Reactor Breach**:
- Extreme danger (radiation + pressure loss)
- Emergency reactor shutdown may be required
- Evacuate engineering
- Assess if reactor containment compromised

**Life Support Breach**:
- Direct damage to APU or water recycling
- May lose environmental control capability
- Prioritize repair of life support over other systems
- Use emergency air supplies

### Multiple Breaches

**If several breaches occur**:
1. Assess which is most critical
2. Seal compartments to limit total air loss
3. Patch largest breaches first
4. May need to abandon multiple sections
5. Critically low air - consider evacuation/distress signal

## Decompression Injuries

### Injuries from Rapid Decompression

**Barotrauma** (pressure injury):
- Ear pain or rupture
- Sinus pain
- Lung injury (if held breath during decompression)
- Treatment: Repressurize slowly if possible, medical attention

**Hypoxia** (oxygen deprivation):
- Confusion, dizziness
- Loss of consciousness (after 15-30 seconds in vacuum)
- Brain damage if prolonged (>3 minutes)
- Treatment: Immediate oxygen, medical attention

**Frostbite**:
- Exposed skin freezes in vacuum
- Tongue/mouth if crew gasped
- Treatment: Slow rewarming, medical attention

**Ebullism** (body fluid vaporization):
- Occurs after 15 seconds in hard vacuum
- Blood/fluids form gas bubbles
- Tissue swelling
- Treatment: Immediate repressurization, medical attention

**First Aid**:
- Get victim to pressurized area
- Provide oxygen immediately
- Keep warm
- Do not give fluids if unconscious
- Seek medical help ASAP

### Preventing Injuries

**During decompression**:
- Exhale, do not hold breath
- Protect eyes if possible
- Get to pressure quickly
- Use emergency respirator if available

**Pre-event preparation**:
- Know location of all exits and bulkheads
- Know where emergency respirators stored
- Participate in decompression drills
- Keep pressure suits accessible in high-risk areas
