# Emergency Procedure: Fire and Smoke Emergencies

**Document ID:** EMERG-020
**Revision:** 4.1
**Last Updated:** 2847.09.28
**Severity:** LIFE-CRITICAL

## Purpose

This document provides emergency procedures for fire, smoke, and toxic fume emergencies aboard spacecraft. Fire in a closed environment is immediately life-threatening due to oxygen consumption, toxic fumes, and limited escape routes.

**TIME CRITICAL**: Fire spreads rapidly in oxygen-rich environments and consumes limited breathable air. Immediate response essential.

## Fire Characteristics in Spacecraft

**Unique Dangers:**
- **Limited oxygen supply** - Fire consumes breathable air rapidly
- **Toxic fumes** - Confined space concentrates dangerous gases
- **No escape** - Cannot evacuate to exterior
- **Electrical hazards** - Most ship systems are electrical
- **Pressurized environment** - Can accelerate combustion
- **Sensitive equipment** - Fire damage can disable critical systems

**Fire requires three elements (Fire Triangle):**
1. **Fuel** - Combustible material
2. **Oxygen** - From ship atmosphere
3. **Heat** - Ignition source

**Remove any one element = Fire extinguished**

## Emergency Classification

### Level 1: CRITICAL IMMEDIATE (Red)
- Fire spreading rapidly or out of control
- Fire in critical systems (reactor, life support, bridge)
- Toxic fumes spreading ship-wide
- Fire threatening hull integrity
- Multiple compartments involved

**Response**: Sound ship-wide alarm, seal compartments, consider venting/depressurization

### Level 2: SERIOUS URGENT (Orange)
- Contained fire but not yet extinguished
- Significant smoke production
- Fire in non-critical compartment
- Electrical fire in progress
- Crew evacuation from affected area

**Response**: Attack fire with extinguishers, seal affected compartment, don breathing protection

### Level 3: WARNING (Yellow)
- Small fire, easily controlled
- Smoke but no active flames
- Smoldering/electrical smell detected
- Single item on fire
- Immediate suppression possible

**Response**: Use extinguisher, investigate source, ventilate area

## Emergency Actions Summary

| Situation | Immediate Action | Time |
|-----------|------------------|------|
| Fire detected | Sound alarm, get extinguisher | <15 sec |
| Flames visible | Attack with extinguisher if safe | <30 sec |
| Fire spreading | Evacuate compartment, seal hatches | <1 min |
| Heavy smoke | Don breathing protection, evacuate | <30 sec |
| Out of control | Seal compartment, vent to space | <2 min |

## Immediate Fire Response (First 60 Seconds)

### Step 1: Alert and Assess (0-10 seconds)

1. **Sound fire alarm**
   - Hit nearest fire alarm button
   - Or announce on ship intercom: "FIRE - [LOCATION] - ALL HANDS"

2. **Assess fire size and type**
   - **Small** - Smaller than a seat cushion, just started
   - **Medium** - Larger than seat cushion, contained to one item/area
   - **Large** - Spreading to multiple items, producing heavy smoke

3. **Identify fire type**
   - **Electrical** - Sparks, burning electronics, plastic smell
   - **Combustible** - Paper, fabric, wood, general materials
   - **Flammable liquid** - Fuel, oil, solvents (may spread rapidly)
   - **Metal** - Burning metal (bright white flame, very hot)

### Step 2: Decide to Fight or Flee (10-20 seconds)

**FIGHT the fire if:**
- Fire is small and just starting
- You have appropriate extinguisher immediately available
- Room is not filling with smoke
- You have clear escape route
- Fire is not in critical system (reactor, main power)

**FLEE and seal compartment if:**
- Fire is large or spreading rapidly
- Heavy smoke obscuring visibility
- No extinguisher available
- Fire in critical system (may cause explosion)
- You are alone (never fight fire alone if avoidable)
- Escape route threatened

**When in doubt, evacuate and seal. Lives more important than equipment.**

### Step 3: Don Breathing Protection (Immediate)

**Even for small fires:**
1. Hold breath or breathe through fabric (shirt, cloth)
2. Get emergency breathing mask if within reach (<5 seconds)
3. Smoke inhalation kills faster than flames

**Toxic fire gases:**
- Carbon monoxide (CO) - Colorless, odorless, deadly
- Carbon dioxide (CO₂) - Displaces oxygen, causes suffocation
- Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) - From burning plastics, extremely toxic
- Smoke particulates - Lung damage, impaired breathing

## Fighting Small Fires

**Only attempt if fire is small, just started, and you have proper equipment.**

### Using Fire Extinguisher

**Standard ship extinguishers are multi-purpose (ABC type):**
- **A** - Ordinary combustibles (paper, fabric, wood)
- **B** - Flammable liquids (fuel, oil, solvents)
- **C** - Electrical fires

**PASS Method:**

**P - PULL** the pin
- Removes safety lock
- Allows extinguisher to discharge

**A - AIM** low
- Point nozzle at base of fire (not flames)
- Stay 6-10 feet back

**S - SQUEEZE** the handle
- Releases extinguishing agent
- Keep constant pressure

**S - SWEEP** side to side
- Cover entire fire area
- Move forward as fire diminishes

**Duration:** Most extinguishers last 10-20 seconds. Use efficiently.

### Fire Extinguisher Tips

1. **Always keep escape route behind you**
   - Position yourself between exit and fire
   - Back toward exit, never let fire get between you and door

2. **Attack fire from lowest point**
   - Heat and flames rise
   - Extinguishing agent works down

3. **If fire re-ignites:**
   - Re-apply extinguisher if agent remains
   - Otherwise, evacuate and seal compartment

4. **If extinguisher empties and fire still burning:**
   - Evacuate immediately
   - Do not attempt to get another extinguisher
   - Seal compartment

5. **After extinguishing:**
   - Watch fire area for 15+ minutes (re-ignition possible)
   - Ventilate area (smoke and fumes)
   - Investigate cause
   - Inspect for hidden fire spread

### Electrical Fires

**CRITICAL: Cut power first if possible**

1. **If safe to reach, cut power to affected system:**
   - Circuit breaker panel
   - Emergency power shutoff
   - Removing power often stops electrical fire immediately

2. **Use proper extinguisher:**
   - ABC or CO₂ extinguisher (safe for electrical)
   - **NEVER water on electrical fire** (electrocution risk)

3. **After extinguishing:**
   - Keep power off
   - Inspect wiring for damage
   - Qualified repair before re-energizing

**Common electrical fire sources:**
- Overloaded circuits
- Damaged wiring
- Short circuits
- Faulty equipment
- Improper repairs

### Flammable Liquid Fires

**DANGER: Can spread rapidly, may explode**

1. **If small and contained:**
   - Use ABC or CO₂ extinguisher
   - Smother with fire blanket if available
   - Cover to cut off oxygen

2. **If spreading:**
   - Evacuate immediately
   - Do not attempt to fight
   - Seal compartment

3. **Never use water on liquid fuel fires:**
   - Water spreads fuel fire
   - Can cause explosive splattering

### Fire Blankets

**Alternative/supplement to extinguishers:**

1. **For small fires or burning person:**
   - Remove blanket from storage pouch
   - Hold in front of you as shield
   - Gently place over fire
   - Leave in place to smother (do not remove immediately)

2. **For burning crew member:**
   - Wrap person in blanket
   - Lay person down (flames rise, lying reduces burn area)
   - Roll to smother flames
   - Keep blanket wrapped until flames out

## Evacuating and Sealing Compartment

**When fire cannot be controlled, containment is critical.**

### Evacuation Procedure (Immediate)

1. **Announce evacuation:**
   - "ALL CREW EVACUATE [COMPARTMENT NAME] - FIRE EMERGENCY"
   - Ensure all personnel accounted for

2. **Close all hatches behind you:**
   - Seal fire in compartment
   - Prevents smoke/fire spreading
   - Dog hatches securely (turn wheel to full lock)

3. **Mark compartment as hazard:**
   - If possible, mark hatch with warning (chalk, marker, tape)
   - Prevents crew from accidentally opening

4. **Don breathing protection:**
   - Emergency oxygen masks for all crew
   - Smoke may spread through ventilation

### Compartment Sealing (1-3 minutes)

**Step 1: Seal all entry points**
- Close and dog all hatches to affected compartment
- Close ventilation dampers if accessible
- Seal any visible gaps (tape, cloth, sealant)

**Step 2: Depressurize compartment (if safe to do so)**

**Depressurization removes oxygen = Fire cannot burn**

**Criteria for depressurization:**
- Fire contained in single compartment
- All crew safely evacuated
- Compartment can be sealed completely
- Compartment does not contain critical systems
- Ship has atmospheric reserve to re-pressurize later

**Depressurization procedure:**
1. Verify all crew evacuated and accounted for
2. Seal all hatches to compartment
3. Open compartment atmospheric dump valve
4. Vent compartment atmosphere to space
5. Monitor pressure - should drop to zero (vacuum)
6. Fire will extinguish when oxygen depleted (30-90 seconds typically)
7. Leave depressurized until completely cool (several hours)

**DANGER: Only depressurize if:**
- Absolutely certain no crew in compartment
- Structural integrity of compartment sound (venting won't cause damage)
- Ship can afford to lose that atmosphere (can re-pressurize from reserves)

**DO NOT depressurize if:**
- Any doubt crew might be present
- Compartment contains critical operating systems
- Hull integrity questionable
- Insufficient atmospheric reserves

### After Sealing

1. **Monitor adjacent compartments:**
   - Check for smoke seeping through
   - Monitor temperature of bulkheads (may indicate fire spreading)
   - Check for fire spread through cable runs, ducts

2. **Prepare additional sealing:**
   - Ready to seal adjacent compartments if fire spreads
   - Position crew with extinguishers at hatches

3. **Assess ship systems:**
   - What systems affected by sealed compartment?
   - Switch to backups if available
   - Determine if ship operations can continue

## Smoke Without Visible Fire

**Smoke indicates fire or electrical fault. Investigate immediately.**

### Smoke Investigation

1. **Don breathing protection first**
   - Never breathe smoke unnecessarily
   - Toxic even if no flames visible

2. **Locate smoke source:**
   - Follow smoke trail (will be thickest near source)
   - Check electrical panels, equipment
   - Check for smoldering materials
   - Use thermal scanner if available (detects hot spots)

3. **Common smoke sources without visible flames:**
   - **Electrical fault** - Burning insulation, hot components
   - **Smoldering fire** - Fire burning slowly inside walls, equipment
   - **Hot surface contact** - Item touching hot pipe, etc.
   - **Overheated equipment** - Not on fire but smoking

### Response to Smoke Source

**If electrical:**
- Cut power to affected circuit
- Allow to cool
- Inspect before restoring power

**If smoldering:**
- Apply extinguisher or water to cool
- Open up area to ensure fire fully extinguished
- Watch for re-ignition

**If overheated equipment:**
- Shut down equipment
- Allow to cool
- Investigate why overheating (blocked cooling, overload, malfunction)

**If source cannot be located:**
- Treat as hidden fire
- May need to open panels, check wall spaces
- Consider sealing compartment if smoke worsens

## Post-Fire Procedures

### After Fire Extinguished

1. **Verify fire completely out:**
   - Visual inspection of burned area
   - Use thermal scanner if available (checks for hot spots)
   - Watch for at least 15 minutes (re-ignition possible)

2. **Ventilate area:**
   - Increase ventilation to clear smoke
   - May need to vent to space and replace atmosphere
   - Check CO levels before declaring area safe

3. **Investigate cause:**
   - Identify what started fire
   - Prevent recurrence
   - Document for incident report

4. **Assess damage:**
   - What systems affected?
   - What repairs needed?
   - Can ship operations continue safely?

5. **Clean up:**
   - Remove burned materials
   - Clean soot from surfaces
   - Inspect for hidden damage (burned wiring in conduits, etc.)

### Before Re-Entering Sealed/Depressurized Compartment

**Do not rush re-entry. Fire may re-ignite if oxygen introduced too soon.**

**Criteria for re-entry:**
- Minimum 2 hours since fire extinguished (4+ hours better)
- Temperature of compartment normal (check bulkheads)
- No visible smoke or glow

**Re-entry procedure:**
1. Don breathing protection
2. Have extinguisher ready
3. Slowly open hatch (crack open, observe)
4. Check for smoke, heat
5. If safe, enter cautiously
6. Be ready to evacuate and re-seal immediately

**If depressurized:**
1. Repressurize slowly (rapid pressurization can re-ignite embers)
2. Equalize pressure gradually over 10-15 minutes
3. Wait 30+ minutes after pressurization
4. Then proceed with cautious re-entry
