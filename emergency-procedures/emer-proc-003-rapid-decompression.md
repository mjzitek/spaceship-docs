# EMER-PROC-003: Rapid Decompression Emergency Response

**Document ID:** EMER-PROC-003
**Classification:** CRITICAL EMERGENCY PROCEDURE
**All Crew Must Be Familiar With This Procedure**
**Last Updated:** 2847.09.29

## Definition

**Rapid Decompression:** Loss of cabin pressure at a rate exceeding 1.0 PSI per minute, typically caused by hull breach, door seal failure, or catastrophic system damage.

**Time to Unconsciousness:**
- At 14.7 PSI (sea level): Normal
- At 8 PSI (high altitude equivalent): 30-60 minutes to impairment
- At 5 PSI: 5-10 minutes to unconsciousness
- At 0 PSI (vacuum): 10-15 seconds to unconsciousness

**YOU HAVE SECONDS TO MINUTES TO ACT. SPEED IS SURVIVAL.**

## Immediate Recognition

### Visual/Audio Warnings
- Alarm klaxon (continuous tone)
- Red flashing lights in all compartments
- Helmet Drop System activates (if installed)
- Computer announces: "DECOMPRESSION ALERT - DECOMPRESSION ALERT"

### Physical Sensations
- Ears pop painfully
- Sudden fog/mist in air (water vapor condensing)
- Temperature drops rapidly
- Objects blown toward breach
- Difficulty breathing
- Dizziness or lightheadedness

### Instrument Readings
- Pressure gauge dropping rapidly
- Error codes: E-HULL-230, E-HULL-240
- Atmospheric warning lights

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (First 30 Seconds)

### Priority 1: PROTECT YOURSELF

**DO THIS FIRST - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

1. **BREATHE OUT**
   - Exhale immediately if breach is sudden
   - Prevents lung damage from pressure differential
   - DO NOT HOLD YOUR BREATH

2. **DON EMERGENCY MASK**
   - Grab nearest emergency mask (every compartment has them)
   - Pull over head, no time for perfect fit
   - Breathe normally once mask is on
   - Mask provides 15-30 minutes of O₂

3. **SECURE YOURSELF**
   - Grab fixed object to avoid being sucked toward breach
   - Large breaches create powerful suction

**Location of Emergency Masks:**
- Bridge: 2 masks at helm, 1 at each station
- Engine Room: 3 masks near entrance, 2 at reactor controls
- Crew Quarters: 1 mask per bunk
- Cargo Bay: 4 masks at entrance, 2 at far end
- Galley: 2 masks near entrance
- Corridor: Every 10 meters

### Priority 2: ASSESS SITUATION (Next 10 Seconds)

**Quick Mental Check:**
1. Where am I?
2. Where is the breach? (follow the wind)
3. Can I reach a sealed compartment?
4. Are others in danger?
5. How fast is pressure dropping?

**Check Pressure Gauge:**
- **Dropping slowly** (<0.5 PSI/min): Small breach, you have time (10-30 minutes)
- **Dropping moderately** (0.5-2.0 PSI/min): Medium breach, act quickly (5-15 minutes)
- **Dropping rapidly** (>2.0 PSI/min): Large breach, MOVE NOW (1-5 minutes)

### Priority 3: TAKE ACTION (Next 20 Seconds)

**Choose ONE of these actions:**

**OPTION A: Evacuate to Safe Compartment (PREFERRED)**
- Move to nearest compartment with sealed door
- Close and seal bulkhead door behind you
- Verify pressure stabilization
- Account for all crew

**OPTION B: Seal the Breach (If Close and Obvious)**
- Grab emergency patch kit (red containers on walls)
- Apply quick seal patch over breach
- See KB-145 for detailed sealing procedures
- Monitor pressure gauge for stabilization

**OPTION C: Emergency Suit Up (If No Other Option)**
- Locate nearest EVA suit or emergency pressure suit
- Don suit as quickly as possible (practice this regularly!)
- Full EVA suit provides hours of life support
- Emergency pressure suit provides 2-4 hours

## DETAILED RESPONSE PROCEDURE

### Step 1: Crew Safety and Accountability (1-2 minutes)

**If You Are Bridge Crew or Senior:**

1. **Sound General Alarm** (if not automatic)
   - Press RED button on any wall panel
   - Or announce via comms: "DECOMPRESSION - ALL HANDS EMERGENCY STATIONS"

2. **Account For All Crew**
   ```
   Bridge Crew: "Roll call, report status and location!"
   Each Crew: "Name, Location, Status"
   Example: "Chen, Engine Room, Masked and Safe"
   ```

3. **Identify Who Is In Danger**
   - Who is in the breached compartment?
   - Who hasn't reported?
   - Can they reach safety?

4. **Coordinate Rescue If Needed**
   - Two-person rescue team minimum
   - Both in suits or with extra masks
   - Never solo rescue in decompression

**If You Are Any Crew:**

1. Report your status immediately when called
2. Help nearby crew with masks if safe to do so
3. Move to safe area
4. Stay on comms

### Step 2: Locate and Isolate Breach (2-5 minutes)

**Breach Location Methods:**

1. **Follow the Wind**
   - Air flows toward breach
   - Smoke or loose paper will show direction
   - Listen for whistling or roaring

2. **Check Pressure Sensors**
   - Bridge displays pressure by compartment
   - Compartment with lowest pressure has breach
   - Computer may auto-identify: "BREACH DETECTED: [LOCATION]"

3. **Look for Visible Signs**
   - Frost forming around breach
   - Visible hole or crack
   - Damaged equipment or panels
   - Debris blown around

**Compartment Isolation:**

1. **Close All Bulkhead Doors**
   - To affected compartment
   - Seal fully (green light on door panel)
   - If door won't seal, use emergency sealing procedures

2. **Shut Ventilation**
   - Close air ducts to breached compartment
   - Prevents pressure loss through vent system
   - Bridge can control remotely: "Isolate ventilation to [compartment]"

3. **Verify Isolation**
   - Pressure should stabilize in unaffected areas
   - If still dropping, breach may be in multiple locations
   - Or door seals may be damaged

### Step 3: Temporary Breach Sealing (If Accessible)

**ONLY if breach is accessible and safe to approach:**

1. **Assess Breach Size**
   - Small (<25mm): One quick seal patch
   - Medium (25-100mm): Multiple patches or foam
   - Large (>100mm): Plate and epoxy or emergency blanket
   - Massive (>300mm): Evacuation only, do not attempt seal

2. **Apply Seal**
   - See KB-145 for detailed procedures
   - Quick seal patches for small breaches (60 seconds)
   - Foam for irregular breaches (3 minutes)
   - Plate and epoxy for large breaches (10-20 minutes)

3. **Verify Seal**
   - Watch pressure gauge - should stabilize or rise
   - Listen - whistling should stop
   - Feel - no more air movement toward breach
   - If seal fails, reapply or use different method

### Step 4: Restore Atmosphere (10-30 minutes)

**Once Breach is Sealed or Isolated:**

1. **Check Current Pressure**
   - Safe minimum: 8.0 PSI (about half normal)
   - Uncomfortable but survivable for hours
   - Below 8.0 PSI: Prioritize repressurization

2. **Repressurize From Reserves**
   - Bridge: "Initiate emergency repressurization"
   - Or manually: Open O₂ reserve valves (blue-marked)
   - Target: Return to 14.7 PSI gradually (over 10-15 minutes)

3. **Monitor O₂ Levels**
   - O₂ percentage should be 19-23%
   - If too low: Increase O₂ flow
   - If too high (>25%): Fire risk, reduce flow

4. **Verify Life Support Stable**
   - Pressure holding steady
   - O₂ levels normal
   - CO₂ scrubbers operational
   - Temperature recovering

### Step 5: Damage Assessment and Planning (30+ minutes)

**Once Situation is Stable:**

1. **Inspect Temporary Seal**
   - Is it holding?
   - Any signs of failure?
   - How long is it rated for?

2. **Assess Ship Status**
   - Any other damage?
   - All systems operational?
   - Casualties or injuries?
   - Supplies depleted?

3. **Plan Permanent Repair**
   - Can crew perform repair?
   - Need to dock at station?
   - Request emergency assistance?

4. **Update Course if Needed**
   - Divert to nearest station if necessary
   - Request priority docking
   - Notify relevant authorities

## SPECIAL SCENARIOS

### Scenario: Multiple Breaches

**If pressure won't stabilize after sealing one breach:**

1. Search for additional breaches systematically
2. Divide crew to search multiple areas (in pairs, suited)
3. Seal breaches in order of size (largest first)
4. Consider sealing entire sections if multiple breaches in one area

### Scenario: Breach in Critical Area (Bridge, Engine Room, Life Support)

**Cannot simply seal off these areas:**

1. Priority is crew evacuation from immediate area
2. Set up emergency command post in safe location
3. Remote operation if possible:
   - Bridge: Use auxiliary control (usually in engineering)
   - Engineering: Remote monitoring from bridge
   - Life Support: Automatic systems continue, minimize manual access

4. Suited crew enters only when necessary for critical operations
5. Permanent repair is URGENT priority

### Scenario: Door Won't Seal

**If bulkhead door damaged and won't seal:**

1. **Emergency Door Sealing:**
   - Foam around door edges from safe side
   - Emergency blanket over entire door opening
   - Magnetic clamps to hold blanket
   - This is temporary (1-4 hours max)

2. **Create Secondary Barrier:**
   - Block corridor with stacked cargo
   - Seal with tarps and foam
   - Route crew around blocked area

3. **Replace Door Seal:**
   - Part #: SEAL-DOOR-BULK-STD
   - 15-30 minute procedure
   - Requires two people and pressure suit
   - See HULL-SYS-004 for procedure

### Scenario: No Masks Available / Out of Reach

**LAST RESORT OPTIONS:**

1. **Wet Cloth Method:**
   - Soak cloth in water
   - Breathe through cloth
   - Adds minutes at best, not a solution
   - Move to safe area IMMEDIATELY

2. **Shallow Breathing:**
   - At low pressure, breathe rapidly and shallowly
   - Increases O₂ absorption efficiency slightly
   - Buys 2-3 extra minutes maximum

3. **Seek Highest Pressure:**
   - Air pools in low/enclosed areas
   - Closets, under furniture, corners
   - A few extra breaths may let you reach safety

### Scenario: Explosive Decompression (Instantaneous)

**If breach is catastrophic (>500mm or door blows out):**

- You have 10-15 seconds before unconsciousness
- DO NOT attempt to seal breach
- EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY to adjacent compartment
- Close door behind you
- Anyone remaining in breached compartment is likely lost
- Do not risk additional lives with immediate rescue
- Plan suited rescue only after situation stable

## AFTER THE EMERGENCY

### Immediate (First Hour)

1. **Medical Check:** All crew members, even if feel fine
   - Hypoxia effects can be delayed
   - Ear/lung damage from pressure change
   - Psychological stress

2. **Temporary Seal Monitoring:**
   - Check every 15 minutes for first hour
   - Then hourly
   - Watch pressure gauge constantly

3. **Incident Report:**
   - Time of incident
   - Location and size of breach
   - Cause (if known)
   - Actions taken
   - Crew status
   - Current ship status

### Short Term (24 Hours)

1. **Plan Permanent Repair**
   - See KB-145 for hull repair procedures
   - Schedule EVA if capable
   - Or divert to station

2. **Restock Emergency Supplies**
   - Replace used masks (O₂ cartridges used)
   - Replace used seal patches/foam
   - Verify all other masks still have charge

3. **Review and Learn**
   - What went well?
   - What could be improved?
   - Any procedure changes needed?
   - Additional training needed?

### Long Term

1. **Complete Permanent Repair**
2. **Hull Inspection** (full ship)
3. **Equipment Inspection** (all emergency gear)
4. **Crew Retraining** if gaps identified
5. **Insurance Claim** (if applicable)
