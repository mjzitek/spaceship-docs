## Immediate Post-Impact Response

### Step 1: All Hands Alert (0-10 seconds)

**If you feel/hear impact:**

1. **Sound collision alarm**
   - Hit emergency alarm button
   - Or announce: "COLLISION - ALL HANDS - DAMAGE ASSESSMENT"

2. **All crew brace and protect:**
   - Grab handholds
   - Protect head and vital areas
   - Be ready for secondary impacts
   - Watch for debris, sparking equipment

3. **Command takes control:**
   - Captain/pilot to bridge immediately
   - Engineering to damage control station
   - All crew to emergency stations

### Step 2: Immediate Safety Check (10-30 seconds)

**Each crew member checks:**

1. **Personal injury:**
   - Am I injured?
   - Can I function?
   - Do I need immediate medical aid?

2. **Immediate hazards in your area:**
   - Fire? (see EMERG-020)
   - Sparking electricity? (cut power)
   - Decompression? (seal breach, emergency oxygen)
   - Structural collapse? (evacuate area)

3. **Report status:**
   - Use intercom or radio
   - Report to bridge: "[Name] in [location] - [status: OK/Injured/Emergency]"

### Step 3: Rapid Damage Assessment (30 seconds - 2 minutes)

**Bridge/Command:**

**Check ship status board:**
1. **Pressure status:**
   - All compartments holding pressure?
   - Any rapid pressure drops? (hull breach)
   - Seal affected compartments immediately

2. **System status:**
   - Reactor: Operating? Critical alarms?
   - Life support: Functional?
   - Propulsion: Can we maneuver?
   - Navigation: Do we know our position/trajectory?
   - Communications: Can we call for help?

3. **Crew status:**
   - All crew accounted for?
   - Any injuries?
   - Any crew in sealed/damaged compartments?

4. **Immediate threat status:**
   - Are we on collision course with more debris/objects?
   - Are we tumbling/out of control?
   - Are we drifting into hazard (gravity well, radiation zone)?

**Prioritize response:**
- **First**: Life safety (breach sealing, rescue trapped crew, fire suppression)
- **Second**: Ship safety (prevent further damage, stabilize trajectory)
- **Third**: System restoration (restore critical systems)

## Hull Breach Response

**See EMERG-015 for detailed decompression procedures.**

### Quick Breach Response

1. **Emergency oxygen:**
   - All crew don masks immediately
   - Even if no obvious pressure loss (breach may be slow)

2. **Seal affected compartment:**
   - Close all hatches to breached area
   - Dog securely
   - Engage emergency seals

3. **If crew trapped in breached compartment:**
   - **Verify crew has oxygen supply**
   - Communicate via intercom/radio
   - Assess if emergency retrieval possible
   - Consider emergency pressure suits for rescue
   - If compartment fully decompressed, rescue crew must use pressure suits

4. **Emergency breach patching:**
   - See EMERG-015 for patch procedures
   - Only attempt if breach small and accessible
   - Safety of crew attempting patch is priority

### Multiple Breaches

**If multiple compartments show pressure loss:**

**This is critical emergency:**
1. Seal all affected compartments
2. Assess which breaches are worst (largest pressure loss)
3. Focus resources on largest breaches first
4. May need to abandon sections of ship
5. Concentrate crew in pressure-safe compartments
6. Send distress signal (ship may not be salvageable)

## Structural Damage Assessment

**Structural failure can cause ship to break apart. Assess immediately after impact.**

### Visual/Sensor Inspection

1. **External cameras:**
   - View impact area from external cameras if operational
   - Look for:
     - Large dents or holes
     - Bent structural members
     - Separated panels or hull sections
     - Exposed interior systems

2. **Internal inspection:**
   - Send crew to areas near impact
   - Look for:
     - Bent or buckled bulkheads
     - Cracked welds or joints
     - Deformed doorframes (may prevent opening/closing)
     - Exposed structure
     - Creaking or groaning sounds (stress)

3. **Sensor data:**
   - Check structural stress sensors if equipped
   - Monitor for increasing stress (ship still bending/breaking)

### Structural Integrity Decision

**If structure appears sound:**
- Minor denting, no critical deformation
- All bulkheads intact
- Hatches open and close normally
- No unusual sounds or vibrations
- **Continue operations with caution**

**If structure damaged but stable:**
- Significant denting or deformation
- But not worsening
- Ship holding together
- **Reduce stress on structure:**
  - Minimize maneuvering (acceleration stresses hull)
  - Reduce speed
  - Avoid further impacts
  - Navigate to port for repairs ASAP

**If structure failing:**
- Deformation increasing
- Sounds of tearing metal, cracking
- Gaps appearing in bulkheads
- Ship visibly bending or twisting
- **CRITICAL EMERGENCY:**
  - All crew to escape pods/shuttles immediately
  - Send MAYDAY
  - Abandon ship if breakup imminent

---

## Critical System Failures

**Impact can disable critical ship systems.**

### Reactor Damage

**See EMERG-005 for reactor emergency procedures.**

**If impact damaged reactor:**

**Check for:**
- Reactor alarms/error codes
- Abnormal temperature, pressure
- Radiation warnings
- Coolant leaks

**Response:**
- SCRAM reactor if any critical alarms
- Seal reactor compartment
- Switch to backup power (batteries, emergency cells)
- Check for radiation leaks

**Do not attempt to restart damaged reactor without full inspection.**

### Life Support Damage

**See EMERG-015 for life support emergency procedures.**

**If life support damaged:**

**Check:**
- Oxygen level maintaining?
- CO₂ scrubbers operating?
- Atmospheric pressure stable?
- Temperature control working?

**Response:**
- Emergency oxygen if needed
- Activate backup life support systems
- Seal damaged life support compartment
- Switch to portable/emergency units

### Propulsion Damage

**If engines damaged or offline:**

1. **Assess maneuvering capability:**
   - Can we thrust in any direction?
   - Can we stop/slow down?
   - Can we adjust trajectory?

2. **If no propulsion:**
   - **Determine trajectory:**
     - Are we drifting into danger?
     - Are we stable in safe orbit/position?
     - Time until impact with hazard if drifting?
   - **Send distress signal:**
     - Provide position and trajectory
     - Request tow/rescue
   - **Prepare for rescue or impact:**
     - If drifting toward hazard, may need to abandon ship
     - If stable, can await rescue

3. **If partial propulsion:**
   - Use remaining engines to:
     - Stabilize trajectory
     - Move away from immediate hazards
     - Navigate toward safe position/port (even if slow)

### Navigation System Damage

**If navigation systems offline:**

1. **Immediate concern - are we lost?**
   - Can we determine our position?
   - Can we determine our velocity/trajectory?
   - Do we know which way is safe?

2. **Emergency navigation:**
   - Use backup navigation systems
   - Visual navigation (star positions, recognizable objects)
   - Emergency beacon (broadcasts position for rescuers)
   - Ask nearby ships for position data

3. **Critical if in hazard zone:**
   - If near asteroids, debris field, etc.
   - Without navigation, cannot avoid hazards
   - May need to shut down engines (not move blindly)
   - Request guidance from rescuers

### Communications Damage

**If communications offline:**

1. **Try all comm systems:**
   - Primary radio
   - Backup radio
   - Emergency beacon
   - Visual signals (lights, if anyone nearby)

2. **If no communications:**
   - Cannot call for help
   - Cannot receive navigation assistance
   - **Self-rescue required:**
     - Assess if ship can reach port on own power
     - If yes, navigate carefully to nearest safe harbor
     - If no, emergency beacon may still transmit position (passive rescue)
   - **Repair communications highest priority:**
     - Without comms, rescuers cannot coordinate with you

## Injury Response

**Impact collisions often cause crew injuries.**

### Injury Assessment

**Common impact injuries:**
- Blunt trauma (thrown against surfaces)
- Lacerations (broken glass, sharp debris)
- Burns (electrical shorts, fire)
- Crush injuries (equipment falling)
- Broken bones (falls, impacts)
- Head injuries (concussion, unconsciousness)

### Immediate Medical Response

1. **Life-threatening injuries first:**
   - Not breathing: CPR
   - Severe bleeding: Direct pressure, tourniquet if necessary
   - Unconscious: Stabilize head/neck, recovery position
   - Severe burns: Cover, treat for shock

2. **Stable injuries:**
   - Broken bones: Splint, minimize movement
   - Minor bleeding: Clean, bandage
   - Minor burns: Cool, cover

3. **Medical bay:**
   - Move serious casualties to medical bay if safe to move
   - If structural damage, medical bay may not be accessible
   - Improvise medical care in safe compartment

4. **Request medical assistance:**
   - Distress signal should mention casualties
   - May prioritize rescue response
   - Remote medical consultation if comms available

**Do not move crew with suspected spine injury unless immediate danger (fire, decompression).**

## Electrical System Damage

**Impact can cause electrical shorts, fires, power loss.**

### Electrical Hazards After Impact

1. **Sparking equipment:**
   - Cut power to affected circuits immediately
   - Use circuit breakers
   - Watch for fire (see EMERG-020)

2. **Power loss:**
   - If ship power offline, switch to battery backup
   - Batteries provide emergency power for life support, lighting
   - Duration limited (hours typically)
   - Prioritize power for critical systems:
     - Life support (highest priority)
     - Communications (call for help)
     - Minimal lighting (safety)
     - Propulsion if needed (avoid hazards)

3. **Electrical fire:**
   - See EMERG-020 for fire procedures
   - Cut power before fighting electrical fire if possible
   - Use appropriate extinguisher (ABC or CO₂, never water)

### Emergency Power Management

**If main power damaged:**

1. **Switch to backup power:**
   - Battery banks
   - Emergency fuel cells
   - Auxiliary generators

2. **Load shedding (reduce power consumption):**
   - Shut down all non-essential systems
   - Keep only:
     - Life support
     - Emergency lighting
     - Communications
     - Minimal propulsion if needed

3. **Calculate power reserve:**
   - Check battery/reserve levels
   - Estimate duration available
   - Plan accordingly (rescue time, drift to port time)

## Post-Impact Procedures

### Once Immediate Emergencies Stabilized

1. **Complete damage survey:**
   - Document all damage (photos, notes, logs)
   - Assess repair requirements
   - Determine if ship can continue voyage or needs port

2. **Temporary repairs:**
   - Patch breaches
   - Bypass damaged systems
   - Restore critical functions
   - Make ship safe enough to reach port

3. **Distress signal / assistance request:**
   - Even if not immediate emergency
   - Report collision, position, status
   - Request inspection, tow, or escort if needed

4. **Incident report:**
   - Document what struck ship (debris, asteroid, etc.)
   - Time, location, circumstances
   - Required for insurance, safety reports

5. **Permanent repairs:**
   - Navigate to port/station with repair facilities
   - Do not continue normal operations with significant damage
   - Full inspection and repair before returning to service

### Continuing Operations After Impact

**Only continue normal operations if:**
- No hull breaches (or all breaches sealed and holding)
- All critical systems operational (or backups functional)
- No crew injuries requiring immediate medical facility
- Structural integrity sound
- Temporary repairs adequate for environment

**Navigate to port immediately if:**
- Any doubt about structural integrity
- Critical systems damaged with no backup
- Crew injuries requiring medical care
- Significant damage requiring professional repair

**Abandon ship if:**
- Structural breakup imminent
- Life support failed with insufficient reserves
- Reactor containment failed (radiation hazard)
- Ship drifting into fatal hazard with no way to stop

## Collision Avoidance

**Prevention far better than damage control.**

### Collision Causes

1. **Navigation error:**
   - Incorrect course plotting
   - Sensor malfunction
   - Crew error

2. **Debris/asteroid field:**
   - Unexpected obstacles
   - Sensor limitation (small debris)
   - High speed (insufficient reaction time)

3. **Other vessel:**
   - Traffic congestion
   - Communication failure
   - Coordination error

4. **Combat/weapons:**
   - Hostile fire
   - Proximity detonation
   - Shrapnel/debris from destroyed targets

### Collision Prevention

- [ ] **Maintain sensor watch** - Always monitor for obstacles
- [ ] **Safe speed** - Reduce speed in debris fields, crowded areas
- [ ] **Plot course carefully** - Avoid known hazard zones
- [ ] **Communication** - Coordinate with other vessels in area
- [ ] **Evasive capability** - Keep engines ready to maneuver
- [ ] **Armor/shields** - Activate defensive systems in hazard zones
- [ ] **Watch rotation** - Prevent fatigue errors in navigation

**Most collisions are avoidable with proper precautions.**
