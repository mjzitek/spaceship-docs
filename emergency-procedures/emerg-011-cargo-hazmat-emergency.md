# Emergency Procedure: Hazardous Cargo Incident

**Document ID:** EMERG-011
**Revision:** 2.3
**Last Updated:** 2847.09.14
**Manufacturer:** Outer Rim Starship Manufacturing

## Scope

This procedure covers emergency response to hazardous materials leaks, spills, fires, containment failures, and other incidents involving dangerous cargo during transport.

## General Hazmat Emergency Principles

**Golden Rules**:
1. **Identify the material** - Know what you're dealing with
2. **Protect yourself first** - Don appropriate PPE
3. **Contain the hazard** - Prevent spread
4. **Eliminate the threat** - Neutralize, seal, or jettison
5. **Decontaminate** - Clean affected areas and personnel

**Never**:
- Enter contaminated area without protection
- Mix unknown chemicals
- Use water on reactive materials without knowing it's safe
- Ignore small leaks (they become big problems)

## Hazmat Identification

### Check Cargo Manifest

1. Access CMS inventory database
2. Locate affected cargo by position
3. Review material safety data:
   - Hazard class (1-9)
   - Chemical name and properties
   - Specific emergency procedures
   - Required PPE
   - Incompatibilities

### Hazard Placard System

All hazmat cargo must display color-coded placards:

- **Red**: Flammable/Explosive
- **Yellow**: Oxidizer or Reactive
- **Blue**: Health Hazard/Toxic
- **Green**: Radioactive
- **White/Black**: Corrosive
- **Purple**: Exotic Material

**Number Code**: 4-digit UN hazard number identifies specific material

### Emergency Reference Database

CMS includes emergency response guide:
- Look up material by name or UN number
- Provides immediate action steps
- Lists required protective equipment
- Gives first aid procedures
- Notes incompatible materials

## Emergency Response by Hazard Class

### Class 1: Explosives

**Incident Types**:
- Container damage (impact risk)
- Fire near explosives
- Unauthorized detonation
- Stability loss (explosive becoming unstable)

**Immediate Actions**:

1. **Evacuate area immediately**
   - Clear all personnel 50+ meters
   - Use intercom, do not enter cargo bay

2. **Assess ignition sources**
   - Shut off power to cargo bay
   - Disable any spark-producing equipment
   - Reduce temperature (cooling)

3. **Fire Suppression Preparation**
   - Have fire suppression ready
   - Foam or CO₂ preferred
   - Depressurization (vacuum) if safe

4. **Stabilize Environment**
   - Reduce vibration and movement (minimize acceleration)
   - Cool cargo bay to prevent heat buildup
   - Monitor temperature continuously

**If Fire Reaches Explosives**:
- EVACUATE VESSEL IMMEDIATELY
- Activate life pods
- Send distress signal
- Detonation likely imminent

**Safe Distance**: Explosives detonation in space creates debris field 1-10 km radius depending on quantity

### Class 2: Compressed Gases

**Incident Types**:
- Cylinder rupture or leak
- Pressure buildup
- Cryogenic spill
- Toxic gas release

**Immediate Actions**:

1. **Identify Gas Type**:
   - Inert (nitrogen, helium): Asphyxiation hazard only
   - Flammable (hydrogen, methane): Fire/explosion risk
   - Toxic (ammonia, chlorine): Poisoning risk
   - Cryogenic (liquid nitrogen, helium): Frostbite and pressure hazard

2. **Evacuate and Seal**:
   - Clear all crew from cargo bay
   - Seal bulkhead doors
   - Prevent gas spreading to crew areas

3. **Ventilation**:
   - If pressurized bay: Increase ventilation to remove gas
   - If vacuum bay: Gas escapes to space naturally
   - Monitor oxygen levels in adjacent compartments

4. **For Toxic Gases**:
   - Don full pressure suit or SCBA (self-contained breathing apparatus)
   - Detect gas concentration with sensors
   - Do not enter if concentration exceeds safe limits

5. **Leak Containment**:
   - Close cylinder valve if accessible
   - Apply emergency cylinder patch kit
   - Move to vacuum section if possible (vents harmlessly)

**Cylinder Rupture**:
- Cylinder becomes projectile (extreme danger)
- Can puncture hull or damage equipment
- Secure all cylinders properly to prevent this

**Cryogenic Spill**:
- Extreme cold (down to -200°C)
- Frostbite on contact
- Rapid expansion can overpressure compartment
- Metal becomes brittle and may fracture

### Class 3: Flammable Liquids

**Incident Types**:
- Container leak or spill
- Vapor ignition
- Fire spreading to other cargo

**Immediate Actions**:

1. **Eliminate Ignition Sources**:
   - Shut off power to cargo bay
   - Disable all electrical equipment
   - Ground any static electricity sources
   - No sparks, flames, or hot surfaces

2. **Contain Spill**:
   - Use absorbent pads or boom
   - Prevent liquid spreading
   - Collect in sealed containers

3. **Ventilation**:
   - Increase air circulation (vapors are dangerous)
   - Monitor for explosive vapor concentration
   - Below "Lower Explosive Limit" safer

4. **Fire Suppression**:
   - If ignited, use foam or CO₂ extinguisher
   - Do NOT use water on most flammable liquids
   - Depressurize bay (vacuum kills fire)

**Small Spill** (<10 liters):
- Absorb with pads
- Dispose in sealed container
- Ventilate area thoroughly

**Large Spill** (>10 liters):
- Evacuate area
- Consider depressurizing bay
- May need to jettison cargo

### Class 4: Flammable Solids & Reactive Materials

**Incident Types**:
- Spontaneous combustion
- Water-reactive material contacted with moisture
- Pyrophoric material (ignites in air)

**Immediate Actions**:

1. **Identify Specific Reactivity**:
   - Water-reactive: Keep absolutely dry
   - Air-reactive: Seal from atmosphere
   - Pyrophoric: May already be burning

2. **Remove Trigger**:
   - If water-reactive: Prevent any water contact
   - If air-reactive: Seal in inert atmosphere (nitrogen)
   - If self-heating: Cool immediately

3. **Fire Suppression**:
   - DO NOT use water if material is water-reactive
   - Use dry chemical extinguisher or sand
   - Depressurization (vacuum) effective

**Special Case - Alkali Metals** (sodium, potassium):
- Explode on contact with water
- Must be stored in oil or inert gas
- If fire starts, use dry powder extinguisher only

### Class 5: Oxidizers

**Incident Types**:
- Leak contaminating other materials
- Fire in presence of oxidizer (intensifies flames)
- Chemical reaction with incompatible cargo

**Immediate Actions**:

1. **Isolate from Flammables**:
   - Oxidizers make fires burn much hotter and faster
   - Separate from any combustible materials
   - Clean up any contamination immediately

2. **Contain Leak**:
   - Wear resistant gloves (many oxidizers corrosive)
   - Absorb liquid oxidizers carefully
   - Ventilate area (some produce toxic fumes)

3. **Fire Risk**:
   - If fire starts near oxidizer, extremely difficult to extinguish
   - May require full depressurization
   - Jettison cargo if fire uncontrollable

**Never Mix**:
- Oxidizers + fuels = potential explosion
- Oxidizers + reactive metals = violent reaction

### Class 6: Toxic Materials

**Incident Types**:
- Container leak (toxic vapor or liquid release)
- Biological containment failure
- Poisoning of crew

**Immediate Actions**:

1. **Identify Toxin**:
   - Chemical poison vs biological hazard
   - Route of exposure (inhalation, contact, ingestion)
   - Lethal dose and exposure time

2. **Protect Crew**:
   - Seal cargo bay immediately
   - Don full pressure suit or SCBA
   - Evacuate exposed personnel
   - Decontaminate exposed crew

3. **Contain Leak**:
   - Stop leak at source if safely possible
   - Absorb liquid spills
   - Ventilate gases to space (if vacuum option available)
   - Seal in secondary containment

4. **Medical Response**:
   - Identify symptoms of exposure
   - Administer antidote if available
   - Contact medical emergency for guidance
   - Log exposure for medical treatment

**Biological Hazards**:
- Infectious materials (viruses, bacteria)
- Require decontamination protocols
- May need to sterilize affected areas (heat or chemical)
- Exposed crew may need quarantine

### Class 7: Radioactive Materials

**Incident Types**:
- Containment breach (radiation leak)
- Shielding damage (exposure increase)
- Criticality accident (rare but catastrophic)

**Immediate Actions**:

1. **Radiation Detection**:
   - Use radiation sensors to measure levels
   - Determine type (alpha, beta, gamma, neutron)
   - Establish safe distance

2. **Evacuate Hot Zone**:
   - Clear crew from high-radiation area
   - Time, distance, shielding reduce exposure
   - Minimize time in radiation field

3. **Containment**:
   - Seal breached container if possible
   - Add additional shielding (lead, water, dense materials)
   - Isolate in shielded compartment

4. **Decontamination**:
   - Exposed crew must decontaminate (remove clothing, wash)
   - Seal contaminated materials
   - Monitor crew for radiation sickness

**Exposure Limits**:
- <1 mSv: Safe (background)
- 1-50 mSv: Monitor for symptoms
- 50-1000 mSv: Medical attention needed
- >1000 mSv (1 Sv): Acute radiation sickness, critical

**Criticality Accident** (nuclear chain reaction):
- Extremely rare but deadly
- Produces intense radiation burst
- Evacuate entire vessel immediately
- Anyone close to event likely received lethal dose

### Class 8: Corrosives

**Incident Types**:
- Acid or base spill
- Vapor release (corrosive fumes)
- Container breach causing hull damage

**Immediate Actions**:

1. **Identify Corrosive Type**:
   - Acid (pH <3): Strong acids eat through metal, burn tissue
   - Base (pH >11): Alkalis destroy tissue, saponify fats
   - Specific chemical (check manifest)

2. **Personal Protection**:
   - Acid-resistant suit or apron
   - Face shield
   - Chemical-resistant gloves
   - Respirator if fumes present

3. **Contain Spill**:
   - Neutralize if safe to do so:
     - Acid spills: Neutralize with weak base (baking soda)
     - Base spills: Neutralize with weak acid (vinegar)
   - Absorb neutralized liquid
   - Seal in corrosion-resistant container

4. **Hull Damage Risk**:
   - Corrosives can eat through hull plating
   - If spill contacts hull, neutralize immediately
   - Inspect for corrosion damage
   - May need emergency hull patch

**Personnel Exposure**:
- Flush with water immediately (15+ minutes continuous)
- Remove contaminated clothing
- Seek medical attention
- Note: Some corrosives react with water (check first!)

### Class 9: Exotic Materials

**Incident Types**:
- Antimatter containment failure (catastrophic)
- Exotic matter instability
- Tachyon crystal overload
- Quantum device malfunction

**Immediate Actions**:

**Antimatter Containment Failure**:
1. **EVACUATE VESSEL IMMEDIATELY**
2. Antimatter-matter contact = total annihilation
3. Explosion equivalent to nuclear detonation
4. No safe distance on vessel
5. Activate life pods, abandon ship
6. Send distress signal with antimatter warning

**Exotic Matter Instability**:
1. Isolate material in shielded compartment
2. May interfere with ship systems (especially FTL)
3. Jettison if instability increasing
4. Contact expert support (exotic materials specialists)

**Tachyon Crystal Overload**:
1. Crystals emit dangerous tachyon radiation
2. Seal in lead-lined container
3. Keep cool (overheating increases emission)
4. Jettison if uncontrollable

**Quantum Device Malfunction**:
1. May cause spatial distortions
2. Can interfere with FTL drive
3. Power down device if possible
4. Seal in Faraday cage or quantum shielding
5. Jettison if safe shutdown impossible
