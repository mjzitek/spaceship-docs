## Rapid Decompression Emergency

**Trigger:** Pressure dropping >5 PSI/minute, or E-LIFE-110 error

**Decompression kills in minutes. Act immediately.**

### Immediate Actions (0-30 seconds)

**Step 1: Sound Alarm**
1. Hit emergency alarm button
2. Announce: "DECOMPRESSION EMERGENCY - ALL HANDS EMERGENCY OXYGEN"
3. Crew should immediately:
   - Don emergency oxygen masks
   - Move to nearest pressure-safe compartment
   - Seal all pressure doors

**Step 2: Don Emergency Oxygen (All Crew)**
1. Locate nearest emergency oxygen station
2. Pull mask from housing
3. Place over nose and mouth, secure straps
4. Breathe normally - tanks provide 15-30 minutes oxygen
5. Check pressure gauge on tank

**Warning:** Do not remove mask until atmosphere confirmed safe

### Locate and Seal Breach (30 seconds - 5 minutes)

**Step 1: Identify Breach Location**

**Check pressure indicators by compartment:**
- Compartment with lowest/fastest dropping pressure = likely breach location
- Listen for whistling/rushing air sound
- Feel for air current (moving toward breach)

**Common breach locations:**
- Hull damage from impacts, debris
- Airlock seal failures
- Window/viewport failures
- Docking port seal failures
- Weapon/tool discharge damage

**Step 2: Seal Affected Compartment**

1. **If crew in affected compartment:**
   - Ensure all crew evacuated and wearing oxygen
   - Account for all personnel
   - Close and dog all hatches leading to compartment

2. **If no crew in compartment:**
   - Close and dog all hatches immediately
   - Mark compartment as sealed on ship status board

3. **Emergency seals:**
   - Engage emergency pressure seals if equipped
   - Check seal indicators (green = sealed, red = leak detected)

**Step 3: Assess Breach**

**Small breach (pressure stabilized after sealing):**
- Compartment can be repaired when schedule permits
- Maintain seal until repair
- Ship can continue operations

**Large breach (pressure still dropping ship-wide):**
- Multiple breaches possible
- May need to seal additional compartments
- Consider emergency repair if breach accessible

### Emergency Breach Repair (If Accessible)

**WARNING:** Only attempt if:
- Breach is accessible and visible
- Crew member has pressure suit or adequate oxygen supply
- Breach is small enough to seal with available materials
- Ship pressure >10 PSI (below this, exterior vacuum too strong)

**Temporary Seal Methods:**

1. **Patch Kit (Best Method):**
   - Clean area around breach
   - Apply adhesive sealant
   - Place patch over breach
   - Hold pressure for 60 seconds
   - Monitor seal - should hold several PSI

2. **Emergency Foam Sealant:**
   - Spray foam into breach from inside
   - Foam expands and hardens
   - Provides temporary seal
   - Must be replaced with proper repair

3. **Physical Plug:**
   - For small holes (<5cm)
   - Use rubber plug, wooden dowel, or fabric wedge
   - Hammer into breach
   - Seal edges with tape or sealant

4. **Emergency Blanket:**
   - For larger breaches
   - Cover breach with metallic emergency blanket
   - Secure edges with tape or clamps
   - Provides minimal seal, buys time

**Note:** All emergency repairs are TEMPORARY. Proper hull repair required at earliest opportunity.

### Pressure Recovery

**Once breach sealed:**

1. **Check ship pressure:**
   - Should stabilize (not dropping)
   - May be below normal (14.7 PSI standard)
   - Minimum safe pressure: 10 PSI (provides ~70% normal oxygen partial pressure)

2. **Repressurize if needed:**
   - Atmospheric system will automatically restore pressure
   - Monitor rate: Should increase ~1 PSI/minute
   - If pressure not recovering, check for additional leaks

3. **Oxygen check:**
   - Verify oxygen percentage >19%
   - If low, increase oxygen generation
   - May need to supplement from emergency oxygen tanks

4. **All-clear criteria:**
   - Pressure stable at >12 PSI
   - Oxygen >19%
   - CO₂ <1%
   - Crew may remove emergency oxygen masks

## Oxygen Depletion Emergency

**Trigger:** Oxygen level <18%, or E-LIFE-120 error

**Symptoms of Low Oxygen:**
- Shortness of breath
- Rapid breathing
- Headache, dizziness
- Confusion, poor judgment
- Blue lips or fingernails (severe)

### Immediate Actions (0-60 seconds)

**Step 1: Emergency Oxygen**
1. All crew don emergency oxygen masks immediately
2. Announce emergency on ship intercom
3. Check oxygen level on atmospheric display

**Step 2: Increase Oxygen Generation**

**If Electrolysis System Operating:**
1. Increase oxygen generation rate to maximum
2. Check electrolysis system status:
   - Water supply adequate?
   - Power supply adequate?
   - System showing errors?

**If Oxygen Reserve Tanks Available:**
1. Open emergency oxygen release valve
2. Set release rate to restore oxygen level
3. Monitor oxygen percentage - should begin rising

**Step 3: Reduce Oxygen Consumption**
1. Reduce crew activity (sit or lie down, breathe slowly)
2. Reduce ship power demand (lower load on reactor = less oxygen consumption from crew exertion)
3. Seal unused compartments (concentrate atmosphere in smaller volume)

### Assessment (1-5 minutes)

**If oxygen level rising:**
- Continue monitoring
- Maintain emergency oxygen until level >19%
- Investigate cause of depletion (leak? System failure? Overcrowding?)

**If oxygen level stable but low:**
- System may be producing oxygen at consumption rate
- Check crew count vs. ship rating (too many people for system capacity?)
- May need to remain on emergency oxygen
- Ration oxygen reserve tanks

**If oxygen level still falling:**
- Critical emergency
- Oxygen generation system failed
- Check troubleshooting steps below

### Oxygen System Troubleshooting

**Check 1: Water Supply**
- Electrolysis requires water to generate oxygen
- Check water tank level
- If empty, refill from potable water or emergency reserve
- Water usage: ~1 liter per person per day for oxygen generation

**Check 2: Power Supply**
- Electrolysis system requires continuous power
- Check system power indicator (should show green)
- If no power, check circuit breakers
- Restore power to life support (highest priority)

**Check 3: Scrubber Function**
- CO₂ scrubbers remove carbon dioxide
- If scrubbers failed, CO₂ may be displacing oxygen
- Check CO₂ level (should be <1%)
- If elevated, see CO₂ Emergency section

**Check 4: System Errors**
- Check atmospheric control panel for error codes
- Common errors:
  - E-LIFE-121: Electrolysis cell failure
  - E-LIFE-122: Water supply depleted
  - E-LIFE-123: Power supply insufficient
  - E-LIFE-125: Oxygen sensor malfunction (may be false alarm)

**Check 5: Leaks**
- Oxygen may be escaping through hull breach
- Check ship pressure (if dropping, see Decompression Emergency)
- Check compartment pressures for isolated leaks

### Emergency Oxygen Sources

**If primary oxygen generation failed:**

1. **Emergency Oxygen Tanks:**
   - Most ships carry compressed oxygen reserve
   - Duration: Varies (typically 24-72 hours for rated crew size)
   - Ration carefully if no repair possible soon

2. **Chemical Oxygen Generators:**
   - One-time use canisters (ignite to release oxygen)
   - Typically provide 6-12 hours per person
   - Use only if no other option (cannot be reused)

3. **Oxygen from Other Systems:**
   - Some fuel cells produce oxygen as byproduct
   - Check if ship systems can be reconfigured
   - Engineering expertise required

4. **Reduce Crew Oxygen Demand:**
   - Crew in emergency hibernation/sleep uses less oxygen
   - Cooldown ship temperature slightly (lower metabolism)
   - Minimum activity only

## Carbon Dioxide Buildup Emergency

**Trigger:** CO₂ level >2%, or E-LIFE-130 error

**CO₂ Poisoning Symptoms:**
- Headache (early warning)
- Shortness of breath
- Dizziness, confusion
- Rapid heartbeat
- Loss of consciousness (severe)

### Immediate Actions (0-2 minutes)

**Step 1: Activate CO₂ Scrubbers**

1. Check scrubber status on atmospheric control panel
2. If scrubbers offline:
   - Restart scrubber system
   - Check for error codes
   - Check power supply to scrubbers
3. If scrubbers online but insufficient:
   - Increase scrubber rate to maximum
   - Activate backup scrubbers if equipped

**Step 2: Increase Ventilation**

1. Increase atmospheric circulation fan speed to maximum
2. Ensure all ventilation ducts open
3. Check air flow to all compartments

**Step 3: Reduce CO₂ Production**

1. Reduce crew physical activity (CO₂ produced by breathing/exertion)
2. Seal unused compartments (concentrate CO₂ removal in occupied areas)
3. Reduce ship temperature slightly (lower metabolism = less CO₂)

### Assessment (2-10 minutes)

**Monitor CO₂ level:**
- **If dropping:** Scrubbers working, continue monitoring
- **If stable:** Scrubbers keeping pace with production, investigate why insufficient
- **If rising:** Scrubber failure, emergency measures required

### Scrubber System Troubleshooting

**Check 1: Scrubber Material Saturation**
- CO₂ scrubbers use chemical media (lithium hydroxide, etc.)
- Media saturates over time (cannot absorb more CO₂)
- Check scrubber media age/usage indicator
- Replace scrubber cartridges if saturated

**Check 2: Power and Airflow**
- Scrubbers require power and airflow
- Check scrubber fan operation (should hear/feel airflow)
- Check power indicators
- Clean any blocked air intakes

**Check 3: Leaking System**
- If fresh air leaking to space, CO₂ may not reach scrubbers
- Check for pressure loss (see Decompression section)

### Emergency CO₂ Reduction

**If scrubbers cannot handle load:**

1. **Vent Atmosphere to Space (Last Resort):**
   - Open atmospheric dump valve slightly
   - Vents CO₂-rich air to space
   - Simultaneously increase oxygen generation to replace lost atmosphere
   - **DANGER:** Can cause pressure loss if venting too fast
   - Monitor pressure carefully

2. **Emergency Scrubber Materials:**
   - Some ships carry emergency lithium hydroxide canisters
   - Open in inhabited compartments
   - Absorbs CO₂ chemically
   - Duration limited (12-48 hours typically)

3. **Isolate and Rotate Compartments:**
   - Seal crew in compartment A with functioning scrubbers
   - Allow compartment B atmosphere to vent/refresh
   - Rotate crew between compartments
   - Time-consuming but can work in emergency

## Complete Atmospheric System Failure

**Trigger:** E-LIFE-100 (total system failure), or multiple critical subsystem failures

**This is maximum life support emergency. Crew survival time limited to oxygen reserve capacity.**

### Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes)

**Step 1: Emergency Oxygen (All Crew)**
1. Don emergency oxygen masks immediately
2. Check oxygen tank pressure (note remaining time)
3. Account for all crew members

**Step 2: Seal and Isolate**
1. Divide ship into zones
2. Seal all pressure doors
3. Concentrate crew in smallest viable compartment (conserves oxygen reserve)

**Step 3: Backup Systems**

**Activate any backup life support:**
- Emergency atmospheric units (if equipped)
- Portable life support (if available)
- Refuge chamber with independent atmosphere (if equipped)

**Step 4: Assess Repair Possibility**

**Check:**
- Power to atmospheric system?
- Visual damage to atmospheric components?
- Error codes indicating specific failure?
- Repair parts available?

**If repairable:**
- Assign qualified crew to emergency repair
- Provide adequate oxygen supply for repair time
- Time-critical: Must restore before oxygen reserves depleted

**If not repairable:**
- Send emergency distress signal immediately
- Provide coordinates and current oxygen reserve duration
- Prepare for rescue or emergency port arrival

### Oxygen Reserve Calculation

**Determine crew survival time:**

1. **Check emergency oxygen reserves:**
   - Portable tank capacity per crew member
   - Fixed emergency oxygen tank capacity
   - Chemical oxygen generator capacity

2. **Calculate consumption rate:**
   - Average consumption: ~30 liters O₂ per person per hour (at rest)
   - Higher if crew active/stressed

3. **Survival time = Total oxygen reserves ÷ (Crew count × consumption rate)**

**Example:**
- 4 crew members
- 500 liters O₂ in emergency tanks
- 30 L/person/hour consumption
- Survival time = 500 ÷ (4 × 30) = ~4.2 hours

**Extend survival time:**
- Reduce activity (lower consumption)
- Cool environment (lower metabolism)
- Crew sleep/rest (minimum consumption)
- Ration oxygen (risky - may cause impairment)

### Emergency Response

**If oxygen reserves >12 hours:**
- Attempt emergency repair
- Navigate to nearest port/station
- Request assistance but not immediate emergency

**If oxygen reserves 6-12 hours:**
- Send urgent distress signal
- Provide coordinates and survival time estimate
- Attempt emergency repair only if high success probability
- Prepare for rescue

**If oxygen reserves <6 hours:**
- MAYDAY distress signal - immediate life-threatening emergency
- Continuous position broadcast
- All crew to refuge area/emergency capsules
- Prepare to abandon ship if rescue not possible in time

### Cold Emergency (<10°C)

**Hypothermia symptoms:**
- Shivering (early)
- Numbness, clumsiness
- Confusion, drowsiness
- Loss of consciousness (severe)

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Crew don cold weather gear, blankets
2. Gather crew in single compartment (body heat)
3. Activate emergency heating:
   - Portable heaters if available
   - Increase reactor output (produces waste heat)
   - Close ventilation to trap heat
4. Troubleshoot heating system:
   - Check power to heating
   - Check thermostat setting
   - Check for coolant leaks in heating loops

**Critical Temperature:** <5°C - Immediate danger, may need to abandon ship if heating cannot be restored

### Heat Emergency (>35°C)

**Heat illness symptoms:**
- Heavy sweating (early)
- Dizziness, nausea
- Rapid heartbeat
- Confusion
- Loss of consciousness (heat stroke - life threatening)

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Crew remove excess clothing, drink water
2. Reduce ship power (lowers heat generation)
3. Activate emergency cooling:
   - Increase ventilation
   - Vent excess heat to space if possible
   - Portable cooling if available
4. Troubleshoot cooling system:
   - Check power to cooling
   - Check coolant levels
   - Check heat radiators (may be blocked/damaged)

**Critical Temperature:** >40°C - Heat stroke risk, emergency medical situation
