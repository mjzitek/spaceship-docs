# Emergency Procedure: Hull Breach and Decompression

**Document ID:** EMERG-007
**Revision:** 5.1
**Last Updated:** 2847.09.14
**Severity:** LIFE-CRITICAL

## Purpose

This document provides emergency procedures for hull breach and decompression events. Rapid response is essential - survival time in vacuum is measured in seconds without protection.

**TIME CRITICAL**: Response time determines survival. Seconds count. Know this procedure.

## Decompression Classification

### Slow Decompression (Leak)
- **Rate**: Pressure drops over minutes to hours
- **Cause**: Small breach (1-10mm), seal failure, micro-fracture
- **Symptoms**:
  - Ears popping
  - Gradual pressure drop on gauge
  - May hear faint hissing
  - Crew has time to react
- **Response Time**: Minutes available
- **Survival**: High if detected and sealed

### Rapid Decompression (Breach)
- **Rate**: Pressure drops in 5-60 seconds
- **Cause**: Moderate breach (10-300mm), puncture, panel failure
- **Symptoms**:
  - Loud rushing air sound
  - Strong wind toward breach
  - Rapid pressure drop
  - Sudden cold
  - Objects pulled toward breach
- **Response Time**: 5-15 seconds to don suits or evacuate
- **Survival**: Good if quick response, moderate if delayed

### Explosive Decompression (Catastrophic)
- **Rate**: Pressure drops in <1 second
- **Cause**: Large breach (>300mm), catastrophic failure, explosion
- **Symptoms**:
  - Explosive sound (structural failure)
  - Violent air blast
  - Instant fog formation
  - Objects become projectiles
  - Immediate effects on crew
- **Response Time**: No time to react, instant impact
- **Survival**: Low without pressure suits already worn

## Immediate Danger Timeline

**Without Pressure Suit:**

| Time | Effect | Survivability |
|------|--------|---------------|
| 0 sec | Breach occurs | - |
| 1-2 sec | Pressure drop felt, ears pop | Survivable if sealed quickly |
| 10 sec | Hypoxia begins, confusion starts | Can still evacuate if nearby |
| 15 sec | Loss of useful consciousness | Cannot help self |
| 30 sec | Unconsciousness complete | Requires rescue |
| 60 sec | Permanent brain damage begins | Medical emergency |
| 90 sec | Cardiac arrest likely | Death probable |
| 2-3 min | Death certain without intervention | - |

**With Pressure Suit:**
- Full protection from vacuum
- O₂ supply: 30 minutes to 2 hours
- Survivable indefinitely until O₂ exhausted

**KEY TAKEAWAY**: 15 seconds of useful consciousness. Must act immediately or die.

## Universal Response Protocol

**FOR ANY DECOMPRESSION EVENT:**

### Immediate Actions (0-5 seconds)

**DO THIS INSTANTLY - NO THINKING:**

1. **HOLD BREATH** (if unprepared)
   - Do NOT hold breath if wearing suit
   - If in vacuum, exhale to prevent lung damage
   - Holding breath causes lungs to rupture from pressure differential

2. **DON PRESSURE SUIT** (if within reach)
   - Emergency suits stored every 10-20 meters
   - Grab suit, put it on while moving to safety
   - 5-10 seconds to don emergency suit

3. **EVACUATE COMPARTMENT** (if breach location known)
   - Move away from breach
   - Exit through nearest bulkhead
   - Close bulkhead door behind you

4. **ACTIVATE EMERGENCY O₂** (if available and can't evacuate)
   - Press EMERGENCY O₂ button
   - Mask drops from ceiling
   - Provides 15-30 minutes breathing air
   - Does NOT protect from vacuum - only buys time

### Secondary Actions (5-30 seconds)

**Once initial survival ensured:**

5. **SOUND ALARM** (if not auto-activated)
   - Red alarm button on wall panels
   - Alerts all crew to emergency
   - "DECOMPRESSION - DECOMPRESSION - DECOMPRESSION"

6. **SEAL BULKHEADS** (if can reach controls)
   - Press BULKHEAD SEAL button
   - Or manual seal from either side
   - Isolates breach to minimum area

7. **ACCOUNT FOR CREW**
   - Who's in affected compartment?
   - Who made it out?
   - Who needs rescue?

8. **ASSESS SITUATION**
   - Where is breach?
   - How severe?
   - Is pressure stabilizing or still dropping?

## Response by Decompression Type

### SLOW DECOMPRESSION (Leak) - Minutes Available

**You Have Time - Use It Wisely**

**Step 1: Detect and Locate (0-2 minutes)**

**Detection**:
- Hull integrity panel shows pressure dropping
- Alarm may sound if rate exceeds threshold
- Crew notices ears popping
- May hear faint hissing sound

**Location**:
- Check hull breach sensors (indicates compartment)
- Listen for hissing (follow sound)
- Feel for air current (cool breeze toward leak)
- Use smoke test (smoke shows air flow direction)
- Check recent activities (docking damage? Micrometeorite impact?)

**Step 2: Don Protective Equipment (2-3 minutes)**

- All crew don pressure suits (precautionary)
- Even if pressure holding, may worsen suddenly
- Small leaks can become large leaks
- Better safe than dead

**Step 3: Assess Breach Size (3-5 minutes)**

**Small Leak (1-5mm)**:
- Pressure dropping slowly (hours to reach critical)
- Can hear hissing at close range
- Pinhole or micro-fracture
- Relatively easy to seal

**Moderate Leak (5-10mm)**:
- Pressure dropping noticeably (30-60 min to critical)
- Loud hissing audible throughout compartment
- Small puncture or seal failure
- More difficult to seal, may need multiple patches

**Large Leak (>10mm but not explosive)**:
- Pressure dropping rapidly (10-30 min to critical)
- Loud rushing sound, strong air current
- Requires immediate sealing or evacuation

**Step 4: Seal Breach (5-15 minutes)**

**For Small Breaches (<30mm):**

1. **Auto-Seal Activation**
   - Should activate automatically
   - Foam sprays toward breach
   - Expands 50x, hardens in 30 seconds
   - Check if sealed (hissing stops, pressure stabilizes)

2. **Manual Sealant (if auto-seal insufficient)**
   - Get emergency sealant canister (Part #: SEAL-FOAM-500)
   - Approach breach carefully (air rushing out)
   - Spray directly on breach from inside
   - Hold for 30 seconds until hardened
   - Multiple canisters for large breaches

3. **Adhesive Patch**
   - Emergency patch kit (Part #: PATCH-EMERG-KIT)
   - Clean area around breach
   - Apply epoxy to patch
   - Press patch over breach
   - Magnetic clamps hold in place
   - Cures in 5 minutes

**For Large Breaches (>30mm):**

1. **May require multiple methods**
   - Sealant plus patches
   - Or temporary plug plus sealant

2. **Consider Evacuation**
   - If cannot seal quickly
   - Evacuate compartment
   - Seal bulkhead doors
   - Accept loss of that compartment

**Step 5: Verify Seal (15-20 minutes)**

- Check pressure gauge (should stop dropping)
- Listen for continued hissing (should be silent)
- Check seal visually (firm, no gaps)
- Monitor for 30 minutes to ensure stable

**Step 6: Temporary vs Permanent**

- Emergency seals good for 72 hours to 7-30 days
- Allows ship to reach port
- Permanent repair requires yard service
- Do not engage FTL with active hull patches (stress may break seal)

### RAPID DECOMPRESSION (Breach) - Seconds Available

**Move Fast or Die**

**Immediate Response (0-10 seconds)**

**If Suited:**
1. Brace for impact (air blast will throw objects)
2. Secure yourself to prevent being pulled out
3. Close visor if open
4. Assist unsuited crew if possible

**If Unsuited:**
1. **DON EMERGENCY SUIT IMMEDIATELY**
   - Grab nearest suit locker
   - Pull suit on while running
   - If >10 seconds from suit: Evacuate instead

2. **EVACUATE COMPARTMENT**
   - Run to nearest bulkhead door
   - Do NOT try to seal breach first
   - Get to safety then assess

3. **If cannot reach suit or door:**
   - Press EMERGENCY O₂ button (buys 15-30 min)
   - Find shelter (behind furniture, in corner away from breach)
   - Wait for rescue (shout for help if comms available)

**Secondary Response (10-60 seconds)**

4. **Seal Bulkheads**
   - Close doors to affected compartment
   - Integrity monitor should auto-seal
   - Manual seal if needed

5. **Account for Crew**
   - Who's trapped in compartment?
   - Are they suited?
   - Do they have O₂?

6. **Rescue Decision**
   - Can trapped crew survive until rescue?
   - Do they have 30+ minutes O₂?
   - Is rescue attempt safe?

**Rescue Operations (1-5 minutes if needed)**

7. **If Crew Trapped**
   - Suited crew enters compartment
   - Brings spare suits/O₂ for trapped crew
   - Evacuates trapped crew to safety
   - Seals bulkhead again

8. **Do NOT risk multiple crew to save one**
   - If trapped crew unconscious or unreachable
   - If breach too severe
   - Accept loss rather than risk rescue team

**Breach Sealing (5-30 minutes)**

9. **After crew evacuated or suited:**
   - Assess breach from inside (if safe)
   - Or from outside via EVA (if accessible)
   - Apply emergency seals as per slow decompression procedure
   - May not be possible if breach too large

### EXPLOSIVE DECOMPRESSION (Catastrophic) - No Warning

**Survival is Luck**

**What Happens:**

- Pressure drops from 101 kPa to near-0 in <1 second
- Air becomes violent wind (250+ km/h)
- Objects become projectiles
- Loose items sucked out breach
- Crew blown toward breach
- Fog instantly forms (moisture condensing)
- Extreme cold (air expansion)
- Sound of explosion (structural failure)

**Immediate Effects on Unsuited Crew:**

- Eardrums may rupture (pressure differential)
- Air blasted from lungs
- Possible lung damage if holding breath
- Instant hypoxia begins
- 10-15 seconds to unconsciousness
- Crew blown into walls, equipment, or out breach

**Survival Factors:**

- **Distance from breach**: Far side of compartment better chance
- **Anchored position**: Strapped in seat, holding fixed object
- **Pressure suit**: Only reliable protection
- **Automatic bulkheads**: If close instantly, may contain
- **Luck**: Being in right place at right time

**Response (If You Survive Initial Blast):**

1. **Orient yourself** (may be disoriented, ears ringing, foggy)
2. **Assess situation** (suited? Injured? Where's breach?)
3. **Don suit if available** (may have been thrown to you or nearby)
4. **Evacuate if possible** (bulkhead may be closed already)
5. **Activate emergency O₂** (if can reach)
6. **Brace and wait** (if cannot evacuate)

**If You're Already Suited:**

1. **Brace for impact** (air blast will hit)
2. **Secure yourself** (grab fixed object, avoid being blown out)
3. **Check integrity** (suit damage? Seal compromised?)
4. **Help others** (if safe to do so)
5. **Evacuate or seal** (depending on circumstances)

## Specific Breach Scenarios

### Micrometeorite Impact

**Characteristics:**
- Small hole (1-5mm typically)
- Slow leak
- May go unnoticed initially
- Often in hull exterior, not interior walls

**Response:**
- Detect via gradual pressure drop
- Locate with sensors or inspection
- Seal with adhesive patch
- Log location for permanent repair

### Collision Damage (Docking, Debris)

**Characteristics:**
- Moderate to large breach
- May have multiple breach points
- Visible hull deformation
- Rapid decompression

**Response:**
- Immediate evacuation
- Seal affected compartments
- Multiple repairs may be needed
- Structural damage may accompany breach

### Combat Damage

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple breaches
- Large holes (projectiles)
- Or burn-through (energy weapons)
- Often with fire, electrical failure
- Crew casualties likely

**Response:**
- Evacuate damaged sections
- Fight fires if present
- Seal multiple compartments
- Triage: Seal what can be saved, abandon what cannot
- May need to abandon ship

### Stress Fracture Failure

**Characteristics:**
- Catastrophic crack in hull
- Large irregular breach
- Structural damage
- May propagate (crack grows)

**Response:**
- Immediate evacuation
- Seal multiple bulkheads (crack may cross compartments)
- Do NOT apply stress (no acceleration, maneuvers)
- Emergency docking or rescue required

### Bulkhead Failure

**Characteristics:**
- Interior door/wall fails
- Exposes pressurized section to unpressurized
- May be result of previous breach + stress
- Cascade failure possible

**Response:**
- Seal adjacent bulkheads
- May lose multiple compartments
- Assess if ship still viable

## Special Considerations

### Breach During FTL Transit

**CRITICAL PROBLEM:**
- Cannot exit FTL tunnel quickly (must complete jump or abort)
- FTL tunnel field may interfere with suit systems
- No rescue available (in quantum tunnel)
- Time to destination may be hours or days

**Response:**
1. Seal breach if possible
2. All crew don suits regardless of breach severity
3. If cannot seal: Evacuate section and seal bulkheads
4. Minimize O₂ consumption (rest, no exertion)
5. Calculate if O₂ will last until FTL exit
6. If O₂ insufficient: May need emergency FTL abort (rough but saves lives)

### Breach Near Reactor

**HAZARD**: Radiation exposure if shielding breached

**Response:**
1. Evacuate reactor compartment immediately
2. Seal all bulkheads around reactor
3. Monitor radiation levels from safe distance
4. Do NOT enter to seal breach without radiation protection
5. Accept loss of reactor compartment if necessary
6. Reactor may need emergency SCRAM

### Breach in Cargo Bay

**Considerations:**
- Large volume (takes longer to depressurize)
- May contain cargo that becomes projectiles
- Cargo may block breach or bulkheads

**Response:**
1. Evacuate crew from cargo bay
2. Seal cargo bay bulkheads
3. Accept loss of unpressurized cargo
4. May be able to seal cargo bay and maintain pressure elsewhere

### Multiple Breaches

**From**: Combat, severe collision, structural failure

**Response:**
1. Triage: Seal what can be sealed
2. Evacuate crew to intact sections
3. Accept loss of damaged sections
4. Assess if ship is viable or if abandon ship necessary

## Survival Equipment

### Pressure Suits

**Emergency Pressure Suit (Standard):**
- Stored in wall lockers every 10-20 meters
- 5-10 seconds to don (practice regularly)
- O₂ supply: 30 minutes
- Full vacuum protection
- Limited mobility

**Work Pressure Suit (EVA):**
- More robust, better mobility
- O₂ supply: 2-4 hours
- Temperature control
- Maneuvering thrusters
- Stored in airlocks, engineering

**Pressure Suit Locations:**
- Bridge: 4 suits
- Engineering: 6 suits
- Crew quarters: 1 suit per bunk
- Common areas: 2 suits minimum
- Cargo bay: 4 suits
- Airlocks: 4 EVA suits

**Practice Suit Donning:**
- Monthly drill: Don suit in 10 seconds
- Crew should know where every suit is located
- Suits checked monthly (O₂ charged, seals intact)

### Emergency O₂ Masks

- Drop from ceiling when EMERGENCY O₂ activated
- Provides 15-30 minutes breathing air
- Does NOT protect from vacuum
- Buys time only

### Emergency Bulkheads

- Automatically close when breach detected
- Can be manually closed
- Triple redundant seals
- Pressure-rated to 1 atmosphere differential

---

## After-Action Procedures

### Once Breach Sealed

1. **Verify seal holding** (monitor pressure for 1 hour minimum)
2. **Inspect damage** (assess if safe to remain in compartment)
3. **Plan permanent repair** (at port or yard)
4. **Document incident** (required for insurance, safety review)
5. **Medical check** (crew may have injuries, hypoxia effects)

### If Compartment Lost

1. **Accept the loss** (sealed compartments stay sealed)
2. **Reroute systems** (if life support or power runs through lost section)
3. **Assess ship capability** (can ship continue mission?)
4. **Plan for port** (immediate docking vs. continue to destination)

### When to Abandon Ship

**Abandon if:**
- Multiple large breaches
- Cannot maintain life support
- Structural integrity compromised
- Fire out of control
- Reactor breach
- More compartments damaged than intact

**Abandonment Procedure:**
- Launch escape pods or lifeboats
- Send distress signal
- Evacuate in order: non-essential first, captain last
- Bring emergency supplies, water, food
- Activate ship's distress beacon
- Stay near abandoned vessel (easier to find for rescue)

**SURVIVAL REMINDER**: 15 seconds of useful consciousness in vacuum without suit. Your pressure suit location should be muscle memory. Practice donning monthly. In decompression emergency, there is no time to think - only act.

**DON'T HOLD BREATH**: If exposed to vacuum, exhale. Holding breath will rupture lungs from pressure differential. You'll have 10-15 seconds of consciousness - use them to find suit or evacuate, not to hold breath.
