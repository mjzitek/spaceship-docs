# Cargo Management System (CMS) Overview

**Document ID:** CARGO-SYS-001
**Revision:** 2.5
**Last Updated:** 2847.09.14
**Manufacturer:** Outer Rim Starship Manufacturing

## Purpose

This document describes the Cargo Management System (CMS) used in ORSM vessels for cargo loading, securing, monitoring, and unloading. The system ensures safe transport of goods, hazardous materials, and specialized cargo across space.

## System Description

The CMS integrates cargo bay environmental controls, loading/securing equipment, inventory tracking, and safety monitoring to manage cargo safely during transport, acceleration, and FTL transit.

### Operating Principle

The CMS provides comprehensive cargo management through:

1. **Load Planning**: Computer calculates optimal cargo placement for weight distribution
2. **Securing**: Automated or manual restraint systems prevent cargo shifting
3. **Environmental Control**: Temperature, pressure, and atmosphere regulation
4. **Monitoring**: Sensors detect cargo shifts, containment failures, or hazards
5. **Inventory Tracking**: Database tracks all cargo items, locations, and status

### Key Components

- **Cargo Bay Doors**: Large pressure-sealed doors for loading/unloading
- **Gravity Deck Plates**: Adjustable artificial gravity (if equipped)
- **Cargo Restraint System**: Straps, nets, magnetic locks, and structural bars
- **Environmental Controls**: Independent life support for cargo bay
- **Loading Crane/Grav Lift**: Mechanical systems for moving cargo
- **Cargo Monitoring Sensors**: Weight, temperature, radiation, and shift detection
- **Hazmat Containment**: Specialized containers for dangerous materials
- **Inventory Computer**: Tracks cargo manifest and locations
- **Airlock/Pressure Control**: Allows cargo operations in vacuum or atmosphere

## Cargo Bay Features

### Pressure and Atmosphere Control

**Pressurized Mode**:
- Maintains breathable atmosphere
- Allows crew to work without suits
- Required for perishable/sensitive cargo
- Standard for passenger baggage areas

**Vacuum Mode**:
- Bay depressurized (exposed to space)
- Used for bulk cargo that doesn't require atmosphere
- Saves life support resources
- Allows large cargo to be loaded/unloaded in space

**Mixed Mode** (multi-bay vessels):
- Some bays pressurized, others vacuum
- Allows different cargo types simultaneously
- Requires proper bulkhead sealing

### Artificial Gravity

**Gravity Enabled** (if equipped):
- Cargo remains "down" during acceleration changes
- Easier loading/unloading at ports
- Better for fragile cargo
- Standard for passenger vessels

**Zero-G Mode**:
- Artificial gravity disabled
- Cargo secured by restraints only
- Easier to move heavy cargo
- Common in industrial freighters

**Variable Gravity**:
- Adjustable from 0 to 1.0 G
- Can reduce gravity for easier handling
- Some cargo may require specific G levels

### Temperature Control

**Ambient** (standard):
- 15-25°C typical
- Suitable for most cargo
- Minimal power consumption

**Refrigerated**:
- -20°C to +5°C
- Perishable goods, biological materials
- Higher power consumption
- Requires insulated bay or containers

**Heated**:
- 30-50°C
- Certain chemicals or materials
- Some biological cargo
- Moderate power consumption

**Cryogenic**:
- -100°C to -200°C
- Specialized cargo (frozen gases, cryo-sleep pods)
- Very high power consumption
- Requires special equipment

## Cargo Loading Procedures

### Pre-Loading Planning

1. **Review Cargo Manifest**
   - List all items to be loaded
   - Note weights, dimensions, special requirements
   - Identify hazardous materials
   - Check for incompatible cargo

2. **Calculate Load Distribution**
   - CMS computer calculates center of mass
   - Plans cargo placement for balance
   - Ensures weight within vessel limits
   - Accounts for fuel consumption during transit

3. **Verify Capacity**
   - Total weight within rated capacity
   - Volume fits in available bay space
   - Specialized cargo has proper facilities
   - Sufficient restraints available

4. **Safety Check**
   - Hazmat separated per regulations
   - Fragile cargo protected from heavy items
   - Flammable/reactive materials isolated
   - Emergency access routes maintained

### Loading Sequence

1. **Prepare Cargo Bay**
   - Clear previous cargo completely
   - Inspect restraint systems functional
   - Test environmental controls
   - Position loading equipment

2. **Load Heavy Items First**
   - Place densest cargo low and centered
   - Distribute weight evenly port/starboard
   - Secure each item before loading next
   - Verify restraints holding

3. **Load Medium and Light Cargo**
   - Fill spaces around heavy items
   - Stack lighter items on top
   - Maintain access paths
   - Protect fragile cargo

4. **Secure All Cargo**
   - Apply restraint straps/nets
   - Engage magnetic locks (if equipped)
   - Install cargo bars/braces
   - Verify nothing can shift

5. **Final Inspection**
   - Visual walk-through of bay
   - Tug test on restraints
   - CMS computer verifies load balance
   - Update inventory database

### Post-Loading Checks

- Close and seal cargo bay doors
- Pressurize bay (if required)
- Set environmental controls to cargo requirements
- Activate cargo monitoring sensors
- Run CMS diagnostic
- Log cargo loaded in ship's manifest

## Cargo Restraint Systems

### Manual Restraints

**Cargo Straps**:
- Adjustable webbing straps with ratchet tensioners
- Rated load: 500-2,000 kg per strap
- Use multiple straps per cargo item
- Check for wear or damage before each use

**Cargo Nets**:
- Elastic nets for securing multiple small items
- Good for irregular shapes
- Rated load: 100-500 kg total
- Inspect for tears or broken strands

**Cargo Bars**:
- Adjustable metal bars wedged between cargo and walls
- Prevents shifting during acceleration
- Rated load: 1,000-5,000 kg
- Must be properly positioned and locked

### Semi-Automated Restraints

**Magnetic Deck Locks**:
- Electromagnetic plates in deck engage with cargo pallets
- Holds cargo firmly to deck
- Can be remotely activated/deactivated
- Rated hold force: 2,000-10,000 kg per lock
- Requires magnetic-compatible cargo containers

**Automated Straps**:
- Motorized straps that extend and tension automatically
- CMS computer controls strap deployment
- Sensors verify proper tension
- Faster than manual strapping

### Fully Automated Restraints

**Grav-Lock System** (advanced vessels):
- Localized gravity field generators hold cargo
- Can secure any cargo type (no special containers needed)
- Computer-controlled positioning
- Very expensive, rare on civilian vessels

**Cargo Pods**:
- Standardized containers that lock into bay fittings
- Automated engage/release mechanisms
- Internal restraints for cargo within pod
- Allows rapid loading/unloading

## Cargo Monitoring

### Load Balance Monitoring

CMS continuously monitors weight distribution:

- **Center of Mass**: Should remain near vessel centerline
- **Fore/Aft Balance**: Prevents pitch instability
- **Port/Starboard Balance**: Prevents roll instability
- **Vertical Balance**: Lower mass preferred for stability

**Warnings**:
- **Yellow**: Load slightly unbalanced, monitor during maneuvers
- **Orange**: Significant imbalance, restrict maneuvering
- **Red**: Critical imbalance, do not engage drives until corrected

**Corrections**:
- Redistribute cargo
- Shift fuel between tanks to compensate
- Jettison cargo if critical (emergency only)

### Shift Detection

Sensors detect if cargo moves during flight:

**Normal Settling**:
- Minor shifts during acceleration normal
- Restraints stretch slightly
- CMS monitors and alerts if excessive

**Cargo Break-Loose**:
- Restraint failure allows cargo to shift
- Extremely dangerous during acceleration
- Can damage other cargo, hull, or crew
- May cause vessel imbalance

**Immediate Actions if Cargo Shifts**:
1. Reduce acceleration immediately
2. Alert crew to stay clear of cargo bay
3. Disable artificial gravity in bay (if able)
4. Do NOT enter bay until vessel stable
5. Re-secure cargo before resuming transit

### Environmental Monitoring

Sensors track conditions in cargo bay:

- **Temperature**: Ensure within requirements for cargo
- **Pressure**: Detect leaks or seal failures
- **Humidity**: Prevent condensation or moisture damage
- **Radiation**: Monitor for radioactive cargo leaks
- **Atmosphere**: Detect chemical leaks or contamination

**Alarms**:
- High temperature: Cooling system failure or fire risk
- Pressure loss: Hull breach or door seal failure
- Radiation increase: Hazmat containment breach
- Atmosphere contamination: Chemical leak detected
