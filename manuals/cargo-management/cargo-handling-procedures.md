**Document ID:** CARGO-001
**Revision:** 4.8
**Last Updated:** 2847.09.14
**Manufacturer:** Outer Rim Starship Manufacturing

## Purpose

This document describes cargo loading, securing, monitoring, and unloading procedures for ORSM vessels. Proper cargo management ensures vessel safety, prevents damage, and complies with interstellar transport regulations.

## Cargo System Overview

ORSM vessels feature various cargo configurations depending on vessel class and mission:

### Cargo Bay Types

**Open Cargo Hold (Freighters)**
- Large unpressurized or pressurized bay
- Capacity: 100-50,000 cubic meters
- Overhead gantry cranes (10-500 ton capacity)
- Magnetic deck anchors for securing cargo
- Atmosphere optional (can be vented for hazmat)

**Containerized Cargo (Transports)**
- Standard interstellar cargo containers (6m x 2.4m x 2.6m)
- Capacity: 10-500 containers
- Automated loading/unloading systems
- Quick-release latches for rapid cargo operations
- Sealed containers (can carry varied goods safely)

**Specialized Cargo (Industrial/Tankers)**
- Liquid/gas tanks, ore hoppers, livestock pens
- Custom configurations per vessel
- Dedicated handling equipment
- May require certification for specific cargo types

**Small Craft Cargo (Shuttles, Scouts)**
- Rear access ramp or side doors
- Capacity: 5-50 cubic meters
- Manual loading (no automated systems)
- Tie-down straps and cargo nets

## Cargo Weight and Balance

### Center of Gravity

**CRITICAL**: Improper cargo distribution affects vessel handling and can cause catastrophic failure.

**Cargo must be distributed to maintain center of gravity within limits:**

**Longitudinal (Fore-Aft):**
- Ideal: Center of cargo bay ±2 meters
- Acceptable: ±5 meters from center
- Critical: >±8 meters from center (vessel may tumble during maneuvers)

**Lateral (Port-Starboard):**
- Ideal: Perfectly balanced
- Acceptable: ±3% weight difference between sides
- Critical: >±8% difference (vessel pulls to heavy side)

**Vertical (Dorsal-Ventral):**
- Ideal: Low center of gravity (heavy items on deck)
- Acceptable: Uniform distribution
- Critical: Top-heavy (high risk of tumbling)

### Weight Limits

**Maximum Cargo Capacity (varies by vessel):**

| Vessel Class | Cargo Capacity (metric tons) | Volume (cubic meters) |
|--------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| Small Shuttle | 2-5 | 5-20 |
| Scout | 5-15 | 20-50 |
| Light Freighter | 50-200 | 100-500 |
| Medium Freighter | 500-2,000 | 1,000-5,000 |
| Heavy Freighter | 5,000-25,000 | 10,000-50,000 |

**Exceeding limits risks:**
- Structural failure (cargo bay floor collapse)
- Reduced sublight engine performance
- Increased FTL power requirements (or inability to jump)
- Damage to landing gear
- Insurance void

### Calculating Total Weight

**Total Mass = Vessel Empty Weight + Cargo + Fuel + Crew + Supplies**

**Example (Medium Freighter):**
- Vessel Empty Weight: 800 tons
- Cargo: 1,500 tons
- Fuel (deuterium): 50 tons
- Crew + Supplies: 10 tons
- **Total: 2,360 tons**

Verify total mass does not exceed vessel's rated capacity (typically 2,500 tons for medium freighter)

## Cargo Loading Procedures

### Pre-Loading Checklist

- [ ] Hazardous materials identified and segregated
- [ ] Weight and balance calculated
- [ ] Securing materials available (straps, nets, chains, magnetic locks)

### Loading Sequence

**Step 1: Heavy Items First**
- Place heaviest cargo on deck level (low center of gravity)
- Position near center of cargo bay
- Secure immediately before loading additional items

**Step 2: Distribute Weight**
- Balance port and starboard
- Balance fore and aft

- Leave access paths for crew movement
- Maintain access to emergency equipment

**Step 4: Secure All Cargo**
- Attach to deck anchor points using:
  - Cargo straps (rated for 2x cargo weight minimum)
  - Magnetic locks (verify 5,000 N holding force minimum)
  - Cargo nets (for small items)
  - Container latches (for standardized containers)
- Test security (push/pull on cargo, should not move)

**Step 5: Final Inspection**
- Walk through cargo bay
- Verify all items secured
- Check for cargo blocking emergency exits or equipment
- Confirm weight distribution via cargo computer
- Document cargo layout (required for insurance)

## Cargo Securing Methods

### Deck Anchor System

**Anchor Types:**

**Magnetic Deck Locks:**
- Electromagnet-based securing system
- Holding Force: 5,000-50,000 N per lock
- Power: Ship's electrical system or battery backup
- Advantage: Quick attachment/release
- Disadvantage: Only works with ferrous cargo, power failure risk

**Mechanical D-Rings:**
- Physical anchor points bolted to deck
- Holding Force: 100,000 N per ring
- No power required
- Advantage: Reliable, works with any cargo type
- Disadvantage: Slower to secure, requires proper strapping

**Hydraulic Cargo Clamps:**
- Adjustable pressure clamps
- Holding Force: Variable, 10,000-100,000 N
- Power: Hydraulic system
- Advantage: Adjustable, very strong
- Disadvantage: Expensive, requires maintenance

### Securing Materials

**Cargo Straps:**
- Material: Synthetic fiber (nylon, polyester)
- Rating: Typically 5,000 kg working load
- Ratio: Use 2:1 safety factor (10,000 kg strap for 5,000 kg cargo)
- Inspection: Check for fraying, tears, damaged buckles
- Replacement: Every 12 months or after 500 uses

**Cargo Chains:**
- Material: Hardened steel alloy
- Rating: 10,000-50,000 kg working load
- Advantage: Very strong, long lifespan
- Disadvantage: Heavy, can damage cargo if improperly padded

**Cargo Nets:**
- Material: Woven synthetic fiber with metal grommets
- Use: Securing multiple small items
- Rating: 1,000-5,000 kg
- Not suitable for: Single heavy items, sharp cargo

### Acceleration Forces

Cargo must withstand acceleration forces during:

**Sublight Engine Operations:**
- Standard: 2-4 G acceleration
- Emergency: Up to 8 G
- Securing must hold: Cargo weight × G-force

**Example:** 1,000 kg cargo at 4 G emergency acceleration
- Force on cargo: 1,000 kg × 4 G = 4,000 kg (40,000 N)
- Straps required: Minimum 8,000 kg rated (2:1 safety factor)

**FTL Jump:**
- Entry/exit produces brief 5-10 G force spike
- Duration: 1-2 seconds
- Improperly secured cargo can break loose

**Docking/Collision:**
- Sudden impacts can produce 20+ G forces
- Cannot be prevented, only mitigated with proper securing
- Reason magnetic locks alone insufficient (can fail under high G)

## Cargo Monitoring

### During Transit

**Daily Cargo Checks:**
- Walk through cargo bay
- Visual inspection of securing straps/chains
- Check for cargo shifting
- Monitor cargo bay atmosphere (temperature, pressure if pressurized)
- Document any issues

**Cargo Computer Monitoring:**
- Weight sensors in deck detect shifting cargo (triggers alarm)
- Temperature sensors alert if cargo temperature abnormal
- Pressure sensors (if sealed containers) detect leaks
- Radiation detectors (for nuclear cargo) monitor containment

**After High-G Events:**
- Inspect cargo after emergency maneuvers
- Check securing after FTL jump
- Re-secure any shifted cargo
- Document damage for insurance claims

## Cargo Unloading Procedures

**Step 1: Pre-Unload Inspection**
- Verify destination is correct (don't unload at wrong port!)
- Check cargo condition (damage during transport?)
- Review unloading sequence (remove in reverse of loading order typically)
- Coordinate with port authority for unloading berth/equipment

**Step 2: Release Cargo Securements**
- One section at a time (maintain stability)
- Store straps/chains as removed (inventory check)
- Use cargo computer to verify weight distribution as cargo removed

**Step 3: Remove Cargo**
- Use appropriate equipment (crane, ramp, manual)
- Follow port safety procedures
- Verify each item against manifest (count and inspect)
- Document any discrepancies

**Step 4: Post-Unload**
- Sweep/clean cargo bay
- Inspect deck for damage (from cargo or unloading)
- Store all securing equipment
- Reset magnetic locks to standby
- Log cargo bay empty and ready for next load

- Fire suppression (beyond standard equipment)
- Radiation detection equipment (if Class 7)
- Personal protective equipment (chemical suits, respirators)
- Emergency communication to hazmat authorities

**Atmosphere Control:**

Many hazmat require specific atmosphere:
- Inert atmosphere (nitrogen purge) for reactive materials
- Temperature control (refrigeration for unstable chemicals)
- Humidity control (for hygroscopic materials)
- Vacuum (for some biological hazards)

Can vent cargo bay to space if necessary for safety

### Hazmat Incidents

**Spill/Leak:**
1. Sound alarm, alert crew
2. Don protective equipment
3. Isolate area (seal cargo bay if necessary)
4. Contain spill (absorbents, berm, collection)
5. Neutralize if possible (acid/base neutralization, etc.)
6. Clean up and dispose properly (cannot dump in space - illegal)
7. Document incident, report to authorities

**Fire:**
1. Sound alarm
2. Evacuate non-essential personnel
3. Identify burning material (use correct suppression)
4. Fight fire with appropriate equipment:
   - Water: Most ordinary combustibles (NOT electrical or reactive metals)
   - CO₂: Electrical fires, flammable liquids
   - Foam: Flammable liquids
   - Dry chemical: Multiple classes
5. If fire cannot be controlled, seal and vent cargo bay to vacuum
6. Report to port authority

**Container Breach (Radioactive):**
1. Evacuate immediately
2. Seal cargo bay
3. Monitor radiation levels from safe distance
4. Do not enter without proper shielding
5. Contact radiation emergency response team
6. May need to jettison container if safe to do so

## FTL Travel with Cargo

### Cargo Effects on FTL

**Mass Affects Jump:**
- Heavier cargo = more power required
- May reduce maximum jump range
- Very heavy loads may prevent FTL jump entirely

**Cargo Restrictions:**

**Prohibited During FTL:**
- Active antimatter containment (interferes with quantum field)
- Unstable isotopes with half-life <1 hour (decay accelerated by FTL)
- Unshielded quantum devices (causes FTL drive instability)

**Restricted During FTL:**
- Compressed gases (extreme temperature changes may cause failure)
- Cryogenic liquids (FTL transit temperature variations)
- Living organisms (FTL transit causes nausea, some species intolerant)

**Secured Requirements:**
- All cargo must be secured for 10 G force minimum
- Loose cargo during FTL exit can cause catastrophic damage
- Verify securing before every jump
