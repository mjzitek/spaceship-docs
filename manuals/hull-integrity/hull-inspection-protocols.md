#### Procedure
1. **Pre-Scan Setup**
   - Update scanner calibration
   - Load previous scan data for comparison
   - Prepare scan grid pattern

     - High-stress areas
   - Document all anomalies immediately

3. **Data Analysis**
   - Compare with baseline scans
   - Identify material degradation
   - Measure wall thickness variations
   - Detect internal delamination
   - Flag any readings outside specifications

4. **Reporting**
   - Generate comprehensive report
   - Highlight areas of concern
   - Recommend corrective actions
   - Schedule follow-up scans if needed
