# Hull Repair Procedures

## Overview
This manual provides detailed procedures for repairing hull breaches and maintaining structural integrity of the spacecraft.

## Safety Requirements

### Pre-Repair Checklist
- [ ] Evacuate affected sections
- [ ] Seal pressure doors
- [ ] Verify EVA suit integrity
- [ ] Check oxygen supply (minimum 4 hours)
- [ ] Establish communication link
- [ ] Review damage assessment

## Hull Breach Classification

### Class 1 - Minor Breach
- **Size**: Less than 5cm diameter
- **Repair Time**: 30-60 minutes
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Crew Required**: 1 technician

### Class 2 - Moderate Breach
- **Size**: 5-25cm diameter
- **Repair Time**: 2-4 hours
- **Priority**: High
- **Crew Required**: 2 technicians

### Class 3 - Major Breach
- **Size**: 25-100cm diameter
- **Repair Time**: 6-12 hours
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Crew Required**: 3-4 technicians + supervisor

### Class 4 - Catastrophic Breach
- **Size**: Greater than 100cm diameter
- **Repair Time**: 24+ hours
- **Priority**: Emergency
- **Crew Required**: Full damage control team

## Repair Procedures

### Internal Patch Application

#### Materials Required
- Nano-fiber hull patch kit
- Structural bonding agent (Type-7)
- Pressure seal compound
- Reinforcement struts (if needed)
- Welding torch (plasma rated)

#### Procedure
1. **Damage Assessment**
   - Map breach perimeter
   - Check for structural frame damage
   - Scan for micro-fractures within 2m radius
   - Document with hull scanner

2. **Surface Preparation**
   - Clean breach area (remove debris, oxidation)
   - Grind edges to 45-degree bevel
   - Apply primer coating
   - Allow 5 minutes curing time

3. **Patch Installation**
   - Cut patch 20% larger than breach
   - Apply bonding agent to patch and hull
   - Press patch firmly for 30 seconds
   - Secure with temporary fasteners
   - Apply pressure seal around perimeter

4. **Reinforcement**
   - Install reinforcement struts if breach > 15cm
   - Weld struts to internal frame
   - Apply secondary patch layer for Class 3+ breaches
   - Install pressure monitoring sensor

5. **Testing**
   - Pressurize section slowly (10% increments)
   - Monitor for leaks with detector
   - Verify structural integrity with scanner
   - Document repair in maintenance log

### External Patch Application (EVA Required)

#### Additional Safety Requirements
- Tether all tools and personnel
- Establish buddy system
- Monitor solar radiation levels
- Check for micrometeorite activity
- Maintain constant communication

#### Procedure
1. **EVA Preparation**
   - Don EVA suit (minimum rating: Class-B)
   - Pre-breathe pure oxygen for 30 minutes
   - Check suit seal integrity
   - Attach safety tether
   - Exit through nearest airlock

2. **External Assessment**
   - Photograph damage from multiple angles
   - Check for secondary damage
   - Measure exact breach dimensions
   - Identify any sharp edges

3. **External Patch Installation**
   - Apply magnetic backing plate (if accessible)
   - Position external patch
   - Secure with hull bolts (minimum 8 per meter)
   - Apply vacuum-rated sealant
   - Install ablative coating

4. **Return and Verification**
   - Return to airlock
   - Complete EVA decontamination
   - Review external camera footage
   - Coordinate with internal team for pressure test

## Special Considerations

### Micro-Meteorite Damage
- Often creates multiple small breaches
- Requires comprehensive area scan
- May have penetrated multiple layers
- Priority: Seal immediate threat, then comprehensive inspection

### Combat Damage
- Assume structural weakening in wider area
- Check for embedded projectiles
- May require frame replacement
- Coordinate with damage control officer

### Stress Fracture Repairs
- Indicates potential systemic issue
- Requires metallurgical analysis
- May need entire panel replacement
- Report to chief engineer immediately

## Emergency Temporary Repairs

### Quick-Seal Procedures (Life-Threatening Breaches)
1. Deploy emergency foam sealant
2. Install rapid-deployment pressure curtain
3. Evacuate section
4. Schedule proper repair within 24 hours

### Foam Sealant Application
- Effective for breaches up to 30cm
- Temporary measure only (max 48 hours)
- Spray in overlapping circular pattern
- Allow 60 seconds to cure
- Monitor pressure continuously

## Quality Assurance

### Post-Repair Inspection
- [ ] Visual inspection (internal and external)
- [ ] Pressure leak test (24-hour duration)
- [ ] Structural integrity scan
- [ ] Thermal imaging check
- [ ] Document repair in ship's log
- [ ] Update hull integrity database
- [ ] Schedule follow-up inspection (7 days)

## Maintenance Schedule

### Regular Hull Inspections
- **Daily**: Critical sections visual check
- **Weekly**: Full hull pressure test
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive structural scan
- **Quarterly**: External hull EVA inspection
- **Annually**: Complete hull integrity certification

## Required Certifications
- Hull Repair Technician (Level 2 minimum)
- EVA Operations (for external repairs)
- Pressure Systems Safety
- Structural Welding Qualification
