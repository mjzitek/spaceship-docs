# Q-Core Reactor System Overview

**Document ID:** PWR-SYS-001
**Revision:** 3.2
**Last Updated:** 2847.09.14
**Manufacturer:** Outer Rim Starship Manufacturing

## Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Q-Core Reactor system installed in ORSM vessel classes. The Q-Core is the primary power generation unit responsible for supplying energy to all shipboard systems including propulsion, life support, weapons, and auxiliary functions.

## System Description

The Q-Core Reactor is a quantum-catalyzed fusion reactor utilizing deuterium-tritium fuel pellets in a magnetically confined plasma chamber. The reactor operates on a continuous cycle, generating between 50 MW (civilian models) to 800 MW (military models) of sustained power output.

### Key Components

- **Fusion Chamber**: Titanium-carbide alloy chamber where fusion reactions occur
- **Magnetic Containment System**: Superconducting electromagnets maintaining plasma stability
- **Coolant Distribution Network**: Liquid sodium coolant system preventing thermal overload
- **Plasma Injectors**: Fuel pellet delivery and ionization system
- **Power Regulators**: Voltage stabilizers and distribution control units
- **Emergency Shutdown Assembly**: Automatic failsafe system

## Models and Variants

### Q-Core Mark III (Civilian)
- Power Output: 50-150 MW
- Fuel Efficiency: 92%
- Expected Lifespan: 25 years
- Common Applications: Personal craft, shuttles, light transports

### Q-Core Mark V (Commercial)
- Power Output: 200-400 MW
- Fuel Efficiency: 89%
- Expected Lifespan: 20 years
- Common Applications: Freighters, mining vessels, mid-size transports

### Q-Core Mark VII (Military/Industrial)
- Power Output: 500-800 MW
- Fuel Efficiency: 86%
- Expected Lifespan: 15 years
- Common Applications: Patrol craft, heavy industrial ships, military vessels

## Operating Principles

The Q-Core initiates fusion by:

1. Injecting deuterium-tritium pellets into the fusion chamber
2. Ionizing fuel with high-energy plasma injectors
3. Containing plasma with precisely calibrated magnetic fields
4. Extracting thermal energy through the coolant system
5. Converting thermal energy to electrical power via thermoelectric converters

The reactor operates in three primary modes:

- **Standby Mode**: 10% power output, minimal fuel consumption
- **Standard Operation**: 60-85% power output, normal flight operations
- **Maximum Output**: 95-100% power output, emergency or combat situations

## Safety Systems

### Automatic Safeguards

- **Plasma Containment Monitors**: Continuous field strength measurement
- **Temperature Limiters**: Automatic throttle reduction at critical thresholds
- **Coolant Flow Sensors**: Leak detection and emergency routing
- **Radiation Shielding**: Multi-layer lead-polymer composite barriers
- **Emergency Venting**: Controlled plasma dispersal in case of containment failure

### Operator Controls

All Q-Core reactors include:
- Manual emergency shutdown (SCRAM)
- Power output throttle control
- Coolant override systems
- Diagnostic panel with real-time metrics

## Normal Operating Parameters

| Parameter | Minimum | Normal Range | Maximum | Critical |
|-----------|---------|--------------|---------|----------|
| Core Temperature | 1,200°C | 1,800-2,400°C | 2,800°C | 3,000°C |
| Plasma Density | 2.0 g/cm³ | 3.5-4.2 g/cm³ | 5.0 g/cm³ | 5.5 g/cm³ |
| Coolant Pressure | 80 PSI | 120-140 PSI | 180 PSI | 200 PSI |
| Magnetic Field Strength | 4.5 Tesla | 6.0-7.5 Tesla | 9.0 Tesla | 10.0 Tesla |
| Radiation Level (exterior) | 0.1 mSv/h | 0.2-0.5 mSv/h | 1.0 mSv/h | 2.0 mSv/h |

## Warning Indicators

Operators should immediately investigate:

- **Yellow Alert**: Single parameter approaching maximum threshold
- **Orange Alert**: Multiple parameters elevated or single parameter at maximum
- **Red Alert**: Critical parameter exceeded or containment instability detected

## Fuel Requirements

- **Fuel Type**: D-T pellets (deuterium-tritium composite)
- **Pellet Size**: 3mm diameter standard
- **Storage**: Cryogenic fuel canisters at -250°C
- **Consumption Rate**:
  - Mark III: 0.4 kg/day (standard operation)
  - Mark V: 1.2 kg/day (standard operation)
  - Mark VII: 2.8 kg/day (standard operation)

## Integration with Other Systems

The Q-Core interfaces with:

- **FTL Drive System**: Provides charge energy for quantum tunnel generation
- **Sublight Engines**: Powers Model-3 Sublight Impellers
- **Life Support**: Atmospheric processing and thermal regulation
- **Shield Generators**: Energy allocation for defensive systems (military models)
- **Computer Core**: Ship-wide power distribution management

## Maintenance Requirements
