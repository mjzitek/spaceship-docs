# Horizon-Class FTL Drive System Overview

**Document ID:** NAV-FTL-001
**Revision:** 2.7
**Last Updated:** 2847.09.14
**Manufacturer:** Outer Rim Starship Manufacturing

## Purpose

This document describes the Horizon-Class Faster-Than-Light (FTL) drive system used in ORSM vessels. The FTL drive enables superluminal travel through quantum tunnel generation and spacetime manipulation.

## System Description

The Horizon-Class FTL drive creates a localized quantum tunnel that allows a vessel to traverse distances faster than light speed without violating relativistic physics. The drive operates by generating a controlled spacetime distortion field around the vessel.

### Operating Principle

The FTL drive functions through a four-stage process:

1. **Quantum Field Generation**: Tachyon emitters create a quantum field envelope around the vessel
2. **Tunnel Initialization**: Field manipulators open a stable quantum tunnel between current position and destination
3. **Transit Phase**: Vessel translates through the tunnel at effective speeds of 5-50 light-years per day
4. **Field Collapse**: Controlled shutdown of quantum field upon reaching destination

### Key Components

- **Tachyon Emitter Array**: 16 emitters positioned around vessel hull
- **Quantum Field Manipulator (QFM)**: Primary drive core generating spacetime distortion
- **Navigation Computer**: Calculates tunnel vectors and destination coordinates
- **Power Coupling**: Interface with Q-Core reactor for energy supply
- **Graviton Compensators**: Prevent gravitational shear during transit
- **Field Stability Monitor**: Ensures tunnel integrity throughout transit

**TU = Tachyon Units (proprietary measurement scale)

## Safety Systems

### Automatic Safeguards

- **Tunnel Stability Monitor**: Continuously measures tunnel integrity, aborts jump if stability drops below 85%
- **Mass Shadow Detection**: Scans for gravitational interference from stellar objects
- **Power Reserve Check**: Ensures sufficient Q-Core output before initiating jump
- **Collision Avoidance**: Prevents FTL activation within 500km of solid objects
- **Emergency Drop-Out**: Automatically exits FTL if critical failure detected

### Manual Controls

- FTL activation authorization (requires command officer approval on military/commercial vessels)
- Emergency abort button (terminates jump, may cause spatial displacement)
- Manual tunnel vector input (override navigation computer)
- Field intensity adjustment (for fine-tuning tunnel parameters)

## Pre-Jump Checklist

Before initiating FTL jump, verify:

- [ ] Navigation computer has calculated valid tunnel vector
- [ ] Destination coordinates confirmed and approved
- [ ] Q-Core reactor producing adequate power (minimum 80% capacity)
- [ ] No mass shadows detected in jump path
- [ ] Tachyon emitters operational (all 16 required)
- [ ] Graviton compensators online and calibrated
- [ ] Crew and cargo secured for transit
- [ ] FTL cooldown timer expired (minimum interval since last jump)
- [ ] All hull breaches sealed (FTL travel with hull damage extremely dangerous)

## Jump Procedure Summary

1. **Initiate Charge Sequence**: Begin powering tachyon emitters and QFM
2. **Navigation Lock**: Navigation computer confirms tunnel vector stable
3. **Field Generation**: Tachyon emitters create quantum envelope around vessel
4. **Tunnel Opening**: QFM manipulates spacetime to form tunnel
5. **Translation**: Vessel enters tunnel and begins FTL transit
6. **Monitoring**: Continuous stability checks during transit
7. **Exit Protocol**: Controlled field collapse at destination
8. **Cooldown**: Systems enter recharge interval

**See NAV-FTL-002 for complete jump procedures.**

## Limitations and Restrictions

### Physical Constraints

- **Mass Shadow Interference**: Cannot activate FTL within gravity well of large stellar objects
  - Minimum distance from star: 2 AU
  - Minimum distance from planet: 100,000 km
  - Minimum distance from station/large asteroid: 1,000 km

- **Quantum Turbulence**: Regions of spacetime instability prevent FTL travel
  - Near black holes or neutron stars
  - Inside nebulae with high particle density
  - Areas with intense electromagnetic radiation

- **Recharge Interval**: Drive requires cooldown between jumps
  - Horizon-1: 8 hours minimum
  - Horizon-2: 6 hours minimum
  - Horizon-3: 4 hours minimum
  - Forced consecutive jumps risk QFM thermal damage

### Navigational Limitations

- **Maximum Jump Range**: Cannot exceed rated range per jump
- **Line-of-Sight**: Tunnel vector must be relatively straight (no sharp curves)
- **Known Destination**: Navigation computer requires accurate destination coordinates
- **Drift Factor**: Longer jumps have increased spatial uncertainty (±0.01% of distance)

### Cargo Restrictions

Certain materials interfere with quantum field generation:

- **Prohibiting Materials** (prevent FTL activation):
  - Unstable isotopes with half-life < 1 hour
  - Active antimatter containment systems
  - Unshielded experimental quantum devices

- **Hazardous Materials** (increase jump risk):
  - High-density exotic matter
  - Charged tachyon particles
  - Graviton-emitting equipment

**See document CARGO-HAZ-001 for complete cargo restrictions.**

## Integration with Ship Systems

The FTL drive interfaces with:

- **Q-Core Reactor**: Primary power source for drive operation
- **Navigation Computer**: Calculates jump vectors and monitors transit
- **Sublight Engines**: Must be disengaged during FTL transit
- **Inertial Dampeners**: Protect crew from translation effects
- **Sensor Array**: Provides mass shadow detection and destination scanning
- **Hull Integrity System**: Monitors structural integrity during field generation

## Maintenance Requirements

**See NAV-FTL-003 for complete maintenance procedures.**

**Critical Intervals:**
- Daily: Tachyon emitter alignment check, field symmetry verification
- Weekly: QFM temperature calibration, graviton compensator test
- Monthly: Navigation computer accuracy validation, power coupling inspection
- Quarterly: Tachyon emitter replacement (consumable components)
- Annually: Complete drive system overhaul, QFM core inspection

## Common Issues

### Jump Initiation Failure
- Insufficient power from Q-Core
- Tachyon emitter malfunction
- Navigation computer unable to calculate vector
- Mass shadow interference detected

**See NAV-FTL-004 for troubleshooting procedures.**

### Mid-Transit Instability
- Tunnel collapse due to quantum turbulence
- Power fluctuation from Q-Core
- Graviton compensator overload
- Tachyon emitter failure during transit

**See EMERG-006 for emergency procedures.**

### Spatial Drift
- Exit point doesn't match predicted destination
- Normal drift: ±0.01% of jump distance
- Excessive drift: Navigation calibration required
- Critical drift (>1%): May indicate QFM degradation

## Warning Signs Requiring Immediate Attention

- Tachyon field intensity fluctuating more than ±50 TU
- QFM core temperature exceeding 1,600°C
- Tunnel stability dropping below 90% during transit
- Graviton compensator load above 90%
- Unusual vibrations or sounds during charge sequence
- Error codes E-NAV-500 through E-NAV-599 (critical FTL failures)

## Emergency Procedures

### Mid-Jump Abort

If critical failure occurs during FTL transit:

1. Press emergency abort button (red, labeled "FTL ABORT")
2. System will execute emergency drop-out sequence
3. Expect rough exit from quantum tunnel
4. Spatial position will be uncertain
5. Navigate to nearest known location using sublight engines
6. Do not attempt another FTL jump until drive inspected

**WARNING**: Emergency abort causes significant stress on drive components and may result in spatial displacement thousands of kilometers from intended route.
