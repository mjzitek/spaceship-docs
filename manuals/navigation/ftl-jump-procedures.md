**Document ID:** NAV-FTL-002
**Revision:** 2.9
**Last Updated:** 2847.09.14
**Manufacturer:** Outer Rim Starship Manufacturing

## Purpose

This document provides step-by-step procedures for executing FTL jumps using the Horizon-Class FTL drive system. All operators must be certified and familiar with these procedures before attempting FTL navigation.

**CRITICAL**: Improper FTL jump execution can result in spatial displacement, tunnel collapse, or catastrophic drive failure. Follow all procedures exactly.

## Pre-Jump Requirements

### Operator Certification

- Current FTL Navigation License (issued by recognized authority)
- Minimum 50 hours FTL flight time (or supervised training)
- Vessel-specific FTL system familiarization
- Emergency procedure training

### Vessel Requirements

- Q-Core reactor operational and producing minimum 80% rated capacity
- FTL drive maintenance current (no overdue service items)
- Navigation computer functional with updated star charts
- Hull integrity at 100% (no breaches or structural damage)
- All tachyon emitters operational (16 of 16 required)
- Minimum cooldown time elapsed since last jump

### Environmental Requirements

- Minimum distance from stellar objects (see mass shadow restrictions)
- No quantum turbulence in jump path
- Destination coordinates verified and approved
- Clear communication with relevant traffic control (where applicable)

## Standard Jump Procedure

**Total Time**: 30-75 minutes (depending on drive model)

### Phase 1: Pre-Jump Preparation (10-15 minutes)

**Step 1: Secure Vessel and Crew**

1. Announce FTL jump preparation over ship-wide comm
2. Ensure all crew at stations or secured in quarters
3. Secure all cargo and loose items (acceleration forces during jump entry)
4. Verify all interior hatches sealed
5. Confirm no EVA activities in progress

**Step 2: System Status Verification**

1. Check Q-Core reactor output
   - Must show ≥ 80% available capacity
   - Temperature and pressure in normal range
   - No error codes active

2. Verify FTL drive status
   - Control panel shows "FTL READY"
   - All tachyon emitters green status
   - QFM temperature below 600°C (cool enough to start charge)
   - Cooldown timer shows 00:00 (minimum interval elapsed)

3. Check support systems
   - Inertial dampeners online
   - Life support nominal
   - Hull integrity sensors all green
   - Graviton compensators ready

**Step 3: Navigation Planning**

1. Access navigation computer
2. Input destination coordinates
   - Use verified star chart data
   - Confirm coordinates with independent source if possible
   - Triple-check entry (navigation errors cannot be corrected mid-jump)

3. Review navigation computer calculations
   - Jump distance (must be within drive range)
   - Estimated transit time
   - Tunnel vector visualization
   - Mass shadow analysis along route

4. Check spatial conditions
   - Navigation computer automatically scans for:
     - Gravitational interference
     - Quantum turbulence
     - Traffic conflicts
   - Verify "CLEAR FOR JUMP" status

5. Obtain authorization
   - For commercial/military vessels: Command approval required
   - If in regulated space: Traffic control clearance required
   - Document authorization in ship's log

### Phase 2: Charge Sequence (20-60 minutes)

**Step 4: Initiate FTL Charge**

1. Press "FTL CHARGE" button on navigation console
2. System will begin automatic charge sequence
3. Monitor status display:
   - Charge progress: 0-100%
   - Estimated time remaining
   - Power draw from Q-Core
   - System temperatures

**Step 5: Monitor Tachyon Field Generation**

1. Observe tachyon field intensity rising
   - Starts at 0 TU
   - Ramps to 450-600 TU over charge period
   - Rate of increase should be smooth and steady

2. Watch field symmetry indicator
   - Should remain ≥ 97% throughout charge
   - If drops below 95%: Possible emitter imbalance
   - If drops below 92%: Abort charge and troubleshoot

3. Check emitter status panel
   - All 16 emitters should show green
   - Power draw should be evenly distributed
   - Temperature rise should be uniform across all emitters

**Step 6: QFM Power Ramp**

1. Quantum Field Manipulator begins ramping at 50% charge
2. QFM core temperature rises from idle (400°C) to operational (800-1,200°C)
3. Monitor temperature curve on display:
   - Should follow predicted ramp (shown as green line)
   - Actual temp should stay within ±100°C of prediction
   - If exceeds 1,400°C during charge: System will auto-abort

4. Check QFM power coupling
   - Power draw increases as QFM ramps
   - Horizon-1: 20-25 MW
   - Horizon-2: 70-80 MW
   - Horizon-3: 160-180 MW

**Step 7: Graviton Compensator Initialization**

1. At 75% charge, graviton compensators activate
2. Compensators prevent gravitational shear during tunnel entry
3. Verify compensator load indicator
   - Should ramp from 0% to 40-60% by end of charge
   - If exceeds 80% during charge: Possible calibration issue

**Step 8: Final Navigation Lock**

1. At 90% charge, navigation computer performs final calculation
2. "NAV LOCK" indicator should illuminate green
3. Computer accounts for:
   - Vessel velocity and trajectory
   - Stellar drift since planning
   - Gravitational influences
   - Optimal tunnel vector

4. If "NAV LOCK FAILED" warning appears:
   - Charge sequence will auto-hold at 95%
   - Review navigation computer error messages
   - May require destination adjustment or abort

**Step 9: Charge Complete**

1. At 100% charge, system displays "READY FOR JUMP"
2. Tachyon field at full intensity (450-600 TU)
3. QFM at operating temperature (800-1,200°C)
4. Navigation locked and confirmed
5. All systems green and stable

**Note**: System will hold at 100% charge for maximum 10 minutes. If jump not executed within this window, must abort and restart charge sequence.

### Phase 3: Jump Execution (5-15 seconds)

**Step 10: Final Confirmation**

Perform last-second check:
- Reactor power stable
- Tachyon field stable
- Navigation lock confirmed
- No new warnings or error codes
- Crew secured notification received

**Step 11: Execute Jump**

1. Press "EXECUTE JUMP" button (yellow, large button on nav console)
2. Computer voice announces: "FTL jump in 10 seconds"
3. Countdown begins: 10... 9... 8...

4. At zero, system automatically:
   - Opens quantum tunnel using QFM
   - Generates spacetime distortion field
   - Translates vessel into tunnel
   - Engages graviton compensators

5. Crew will experience:
   - Brief sensation of falling or disorientation (1-2 seconds)
   - Possible mild nausea (normal, varies by individual)
   - Visual distortion through viewports
   - Slight vibration or humming sound

6. Main viewscreen will show:
   - Normal space "folds away"
   - Brief period of visual distortion
   - Transition to FTL tunnel visualization (purple/blue swirling patterns)

**Step 12: Confirm Transit Mode**

1. Status display shows "IN FTL TRANSIT"
2. Verify all systems stable:
   - Tunnel stability index: Should be 95-99%
   - Tachyon field: Maintaining 450-600 TU
   - QFM temperature: 800-1,200°C (stable)
   - Power draw: 40-70% of maximum (sustained)
   - Graviton compensator load: 40-70%

3. Navigation displays estimated time to destination
   - Horizon-1: Hours to days depending on distance
   - Horizon-2: Hours to 1-2 days
   - Horizon-3: Hours (long range jumps)

### Phase 4: In-Transit Monitoring (variable duration)

**Step 13: Continuous Monitoring**

1. Assign crew member to monitor FTL status (required for jumps >6 hours)
2. Check status every 30 minutes minimum:
   - Tunnel stability (must remain ≥ 90%)
   - System temperatures
   - Power consumption
   - Time remaining

3. Watch for warning indicators:
   - Stability degradation
   - Temperature excursions
   - Power fluctuations
   - Unusual vibrations or sounds

4. Log all parameter readings in jump log (required by regulation)

**Step 14: Respond to Anomalies**

If tunnel stability drops below 95%:
- Increase tachyon field intensity by 25-50 TU
- Verify Q-Core maintaining adequate power
- If stability continues dropping: Prepare for possible abort

If QFM temperature rises above 1,400°C:
- Reduce power to QFM by 10%
- Accept slight reduction in transit speed
- If temperature reaches 1,600°C: Initiate emergency drop-out

If graviton compensator overloading (>90%):
- Indicates gravitational interference
- May be passing near unseen mass
- Monitor closely; may resolve as distance increases
- If reaches 95%: Strongly consider emergency abort

**See EMERG-006 for mid-transit emergency procedures.**

### Phase 5: Jump Exit (15-30 seconds)

**Step 15: Exit Approach**

1. Navigation computer announces: "FTL exit in 5 minutes"
2. Alert crew to prepare for exit
3. Verify systems ready for exit:
   - Inertial dampeners at maximum
   - Sublight engines in standby (for post-jump maneuvering)
   - Sensors ready to scan destination area

2. At 1 minute to exit, computer announces countdown

**Step 16: Controlled Field Collapse**

1. At exit point, system automatically:
   - Reduces tachyon field intensity
   - Initiates QFM shutdown sequence
   - Collapses quantum tunnel in controlled manner
   - Translates vessel back to normal space

2. Crew will experience:
   - Reverse of entry sensations
   - Brief disorientation (1-2 seconds)
   - Sensation of "snapping back" to normal space
   - Possible mild nausea

3. Main viewscreen will show:
   - Tunnel visualization fades
   - Normal space "resolves" into view
   - Destination stellar objects become visible

**Step 17: Confirm Successful Exit**

1. Status display shows "FTL EXIT COMPLETE"
2. Verify position:
   - Navigation computer shows actual exit coordinates
   - Compare to planned destination
   - Drift should be ≤ 0.01% of jump distance
   - If drift excessive: May indicate navigation system issue

3. Check systems post-exit:
   - Q-Core reactor stable
   - FTL drive entering cooldown mode
   - Sublight engines available if needed
   - All ship systems nominal

4. Activate sensors and scan local area:
   - Verify no immediate hazards
   - Check for traffic or obstacles
   - Confirm arrived at intended destination

### Phase 6: Post-Jump Procedures (5-10 minutes)

**Step 18: FTL Drive Cooldown**

1. System automatically enters cooldown mode
2. Tachyon emitters power down
3. QFM temperature begins declining
4. Cooldown timer starts:
   - Horizon-1: 8 hours
   - Horizon-2: 6 hours
   - Horizon-3: 4 hours

5. Do not attempt another jump until cooldown complete

**Step 19: System Health Check**

1. Review FTL drive status:
   - Check for any error codes or warnings
   - Verify all parameters returning to normal
   - Note any anomalies during jump

2. Run post-jump diagnostic:
   - Navigation computer: System > FTL > Post-Jump Diagnostic
   - Takes 5 minutes
   - Reports on drive health, emitter status, QFM condition

3. Document jump in ship's log:
   - Departure time and location
   - Destination time and location
   - Jump duration
   - Any anomalies or issues
   - Fuel consumption

**Step 20: Resume Normal Operations**

1. Announce jump complete to crew
2. Crew may resume normal activities
3. Unsecure cargo and equipment
4. Proceed with mission using sublight engines as needed

## Emergency Abort Procedure (Any Phase)

**Use only in critical situations:**

1. Press red "FTL ABORT" button
2. Hold for 3 seconds until confirmation tone
3. System will execute emergency drop-out:
   - Immediate tachyon field collapse
   - Rapid QFM shutdown
   - Emergency tunnel exit

4. Expect rough exit from quantum tunnel:
   - Significant vibration and noise
   - Strong acceleration forces (inertial dampeners may not fully compensate)
   - Possible spatial displacement (exit location unpredictable)

5. After emergency abort:
   - Check all systems for damage
   - Determine position using sensors and star charts
   - Do not attempt FTL jump until drive inspected
   - Contact ORSM support for post-abort procedures

**WARNING**: Emergency abort stresses FTL components and may cause damage. Use only when continuing jump poses greater risk.

## Special Procedures

### Short-Range Jump (< 5 light-years)

For very short jumps:
- Charge time may be reduced
- System will automatically optimize for short distance
- Cooldown period same as standard jumps (cannot chain short jumps rapidly)

### Maximum Range Jump

For jumps at drive's maximum range:
- Charge time may be extended 10-20%
- Transit time significantly longer
- Higher fuel consumption from Q-Core
- Increased spatial drift possible (±0.02% vs ±0.01%)
- Extra monitoring recommended

### Jump in Hazardous Conditions

If must jump from sub-optimal location:
- Minimum safe distance rules still apply
- Expect increased charge time
- Higher risk of instability
- Consider waiting for better conditions if possible

### Multiple Jump Route

For destinations beyond single-jump range:
- Plan jump sequence in advance
- Account for mandatory cooldown between jumps
- Total time = (jump times) + (cooldown periods)
- Verify intermediate waypoints safe locations

## Common Jump Errors

### E-NAV-501: Insufficient Power
- Q-Core not producing minimum 80% capacity
- Increase reactor output before attempting jump
- May indicate reactor issue requiring maintenance

### E-NAV-502: Mass Shadow Detected
- Too close to stellar object or large mass
- Must increase distance before jump possible
- Use sublight engines to clear gravity well

### E-NAV-503: Cooldown Timer Active
- Attempted jump before minimum interval elapsed
- Must wait for cooldown completion
- No override available (attempting jump would damage drive)

### E-NAV-504: Navigation Lock Failed
- Computer unable to calculate stable tunnel vector
- May indicate destination too far, or spatial interference
- Verify coordinates and try different destination or timing

### E-NAV-505: Tachyon Emitter Failure
- One or more of 16 emitters not responding
- All emitters required for safe jump
- Must repair/replace failed emitter before jumping

**See NAV-FTL-004 for complete troubleshooting guide.**

## Regulatory Requirements

### Jump Logging

Required by interstellar maritime law:
- Record all jumps in official ship's log

- Retain logs minimum 5 years
- Make available to inspectors upon request

### Traffic Control

In regulated space:
- Obtain jump clearance before executing
- Follow assigned jump vectors and timing
- Report arrival at destination
- Penalties for unauthorized jumps can be severe

### Crew Certification

- FTL operator must hold current license
- License must be appropriate for vessel class
- Periodic recertification required (typically every 2 years)
