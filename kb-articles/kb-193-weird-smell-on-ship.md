## Emergency Responses (Critical Smells)

### Solution A: Burning Plastic / Electrical Fire Smell (IMMEDIATE)

**This indicates active electrical fire or imminent fire. Act immediately.**

**Emergency Actions:**

1. **Sound alarm**: "ELECTRICAL FIRE ALERT - ALL CREW"

2. **Locate source immediately:**
   - Follow smell to strongest point
   - Look for:
     - Smoke or haze
     - Sparking equipment
     - Discolored panels or walls (heat staining)
     - Hot surfaces (careful, don't touch - hover hand nearby)

3. **Cut power to affected area:**
   - If specific equipment identified: Unplug or shut down
   - If area identified: Cut power via circuit breakers
   - **DO NOT use water** - electrical fire

4. **If fire visible:**
   - Use ABC or CO₂ fire extinguisher
   - Aim at base of fire
   - **SEE EMERG-020: Fire Emergency Procedures**

5. **If source located but no visible fire:**
   - Keep power off to area/equipment
   - Continue monitoring
   - Burning smell without visible fire often means fire inside wall/panel
   - May need to open panel to inspect (be ready with extinguisher)

6. **If source cannot be located:**
   - Burning smell with no source is VERY dangerous (hidden fire)
   - Shut down power to sections systematically until smell stops
   - Inspect all areas carefully
   - Consider thermal imaging if available

**Do not ignore burning smell - it means something is on fire or about to be.**

**Escalate immediately if:**
- Fire cannot be located or extinguished
- Smell continues after power shutoff
- Multiple areas affected
- Safety concern

### Solution B: Rotten Eggs / Sulfur Smell (URGENT)

**Possible hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) from life support or other toxic gas. Can be immediately lethal.**

**Emergency Actions:**

1. **Assess crew symptoms:**
   - Headache, dizziness, nausea → Mild exposure
   - Difficulty breathing, confusion → Moderate exposure
   - Loss of consciousness → Severe exposure (IMMEDIATE MEDICAL)

2. **If symptoms severe:**
   - Evacuate affected area immediately
   - Don emergency oxygen masks
   - Move to fresh air section of ship

3. **Check life support system:**
   - Navigate to: Life Support > Atmospheric Processing
   - Check for error codes (E-LIFE-130 series = contamination)
   - Check CO₂ scrubbers (failure can produce sulfur compounds)
   - Check water recycling system (bacterial contamination produces H₂S)

4. **Increase ventilation:**
   - Navigate to: Life Support > Ventilation
   - Set to maximum (flush contaminated air)
   - Monitor air quality sensors

5. **If smell from specific equipment:**
   - Shut down suspect equipment
   - Seal area if possible
   - May be contaminated water, failed filter, or bacterial growth

**Hydrogen sulfide paralyzes sense of smell at high concentration - if you smell it then can't, concentration may have increased to lethal levels. Evacuate immediately if smell disappears suddenly.**

**Escalate immediately if:**
- Crew experiencing severe symptoms
- Smell ship-wide or cannot isolate
- Life support system showing errors
- Any loss of consciousness

### Solution C: Sweet Chemical / Solvent Smell (URGENT)

**Indicates fuel, coolant, or hazmat leak. Many are toxic and/or flammable.**

**Emergency Actions:**

1. **Locate source:**
   - Follow smell
   - Look for:
     - Liquid puddles or wet spots
     - Vapor or haze
     - Damaged containers or pipes

2. **Identify chemical if possible:**
   - Reactor coolant: Silver-gray liquid, sweet smell (toxic)
   - Fuel: Clear/amber liquid, hydrocarbon smell (flammable)
   - Cargo chemicals: Check cargo manifest

3. **Evacuate and seal:**
   - Evacuate affected area
   - Seal compartment (close hatches)
   - Don breathing protection if available

4. **Check for fire hazard:**
   - If fuel or flammable solvent:
     - Cut electrical power to area (prevent ignition)
     - Activate ventilation (reduce vapor concentration)
     - NO FLAMES, SPARKS, OR IGNITION SOURCES

5. **Contain leak if safe:**
   - Only if crew has protective equipment
   - Use absorbent pads for small spills
   - Patch leaking containers/pipes if accessible
   - **SEE EMERG-011: Cargo Hazmat Emergency**

**Do not enter contaminated area without breathing protection - many chemicals cause unconsciousness in seconds.**

**Escalate immediately if:**
- Large leak or rapidly spreading
- Toxic or unknown chemical
- Fire or explosion risk
- Crew exposure/symptoms

### Solution D: Acrid / Bitter Smell with Breathing Difficulty (URGENT)

**Combustion products, toxic smoke, or chemical fumes. Immediate respiratory hazard.**

**Emergency Actions:**

1. **All crew don emergency oxygen masks immediately**

2. **Locate source:**
   - Smoke from fire? → See Solution A
   - Chemical leak? → See Solution C
   - System malfunction? → Check for errors

3. **Evacuate affected areas**

4. **Increase ventilation:**
   - Maximum ventilation rate
   - May need to vent to space and replenish
   - Monitor oxygen and CO₂ levels

5. **Medical assessment:**
   - Check crew for respiratory distress
   - Oxygen support if needed
   - Fresh air and rest
   - Monitor for delayed symptoms (some gases cause injury hours later)

**Escalate immediately** - this is always serious.

## Non-Critical Smell Investigation

### Solution E: Musty / Moldy Smell

**Cause**: Moisture accumulation, mold or mildew growth in ventilation or damp areas.

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Locate moisture source:**
   - Common areas:
     - Ventilation ducts (condensation)
     - Bathrooms/head (humidity)
     - Galley (cooking steam)
     - Water system leaks
     - Crew quarters (inadequate ventilation)

2. **Check humidity levels:**
   - Navigate to: Life Support > Environmental > Humidity
   - Should be 30-50% for comfort and mold prevention
   - If >60%: Excess humidity promoting mold growth

3. **Increase ventilation:**
   - Run fans to circulate air
   - Use dehumidifier if equipped
   - Open internal vents between compartments

4. **Clean affected areas:**
   - Visible mold: Clean with anti-fungal cleaner
   - Ventilation ducts: May need cleaning/replacement of filters
   - Replace porous materials if heavily contaminated (fabric, padding)

5. **Fix moisture source:**
   - Repair water leaks
   - Improve ventilation in humid areas
   - Use moisture absorbers in problem areas

**Health note**: Mold can cause allergies and respiratory irritation. Address promptly but not immediately life-threatening.

### Solution F: Sewage / Waste Smell

**Cause**: Waste system leak, tank overflow, or drain backup.

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Check waste system status:**
   - Navigate to: Life Support > Waste Management
   - Check waste tank level (may be full)
   - Check for system errors

2. **If tank full:**
   - Empty tank at next opportunity (station dump or space jettison if permitted)
   - Some ships alert at 80% full - don't ignore warnings

3. **Check for leaks:**
   - Inspect waste lines and connections
   - Look for wet spots, drips, or puddles
   - Check seals on waste tank and toilet

4. **Check drain traps:**
   - Dry drain trap allows sewer gas into cabin
   - Pour water into drains to refill trap (creates seal)
   - Especially in unused sinks/showers

5. **Ventilate:**
   - Increase airflow
   - Use air fresheners if desired (masks but doesn't fix)

6. **If leak found:**
   - Repair leaking connections
   - Replace failed seals
   - May need professional waste system service

**Unpleasant but usually not dangerous. Address at next convenient opportunity.**

### Solution G: Metallic / Ozone Smell

**Cause**: Electrical arcing, high voltage equipment, or ionization.

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Determine if normal or abnormal:**
   - Some equipment produces ozone smell during normal operation:
     - Ion drives
     - Some air purifiers
     - High-voltage systems
   - If smell is new/changed, investigate

2. **Check electrical systems:**
   - Look for:
     - Sparking
     - Discolored outlets or switches
     - Warm/hot electrical panels
   - If found: Shut down affected circuit

3. **Check for arcing:**
   - Electrical arc produces metallic/ozone smell
   - Can indicate loose connection or insulation failure
   - Arcing can start fire - investigate thoroughly

4. **If from specific equipment:**
   - Some equipment normal (ion drive, etc.)
   - If new smell from equipment, may indicate malfunction
   - Consult equipment manual

**Ozone in high concentration is respiratory irritant. If smell strong, increase ventilation.**

### Solution H: Cooking Smell (No Cooking Activity)

**Cause**: Forgotten food, galley equipment malfunction, or food waste.

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Check galley:**
   - Look for:
     - Food left in oven/microwave
     - Burners left on
     - Spilled food on hot surfaces

2. **Check food storage:**
   - Spoiled food in refrigerator
   - Trash that needs emptying
   - Food waste bin full

3. **Clean as needed:**
   - Remove forgotten food
   - Clean spills
   - Empty trash
   - Run ventilation fan

**Usually harmless. Clean and ventilate.**

## General Odor Investigation Approach

**If smell doesn't fit categories above:**

1. **Gather information:**
   - When did smell start?
   - Is it constant or intermittent?
   - Localized or ship-wide?
   - Any other symptoms or issues?

2. **Systematically check:**
   - Life support (atmospheric processing, ventilation)
   - Electrical systems (check panels, look for hot spots)
   - Fluid systems (fuel, coolant, water, waste)
   - Cargo (if carrying freight)
   - Galley and food storage

3. **Use process of elimination:**
   - Seal off sections, see if smell persists
   - Turn off systems one by one (if safe)
   - Follow nose to strongest concentration

## Escalation Criteria

Escalate immediately if:

- Any critical smell (electrical, chemical, toxic)
- Crew experiencing symptoms (headache, nausea, breathing difficulty, dizziness)
- Smell continues despite troubleshooting
- Source cannot be identified
- Safety concern or health risk
- Fire suspected

## Prevention Tips

- **Regular cleaning**: Prevents buildup of odor-causing materials
- **Maintain ventilation**: Good airflow prevents concentration of smells
- **Prompt leak repair**: Small leaks become big smells
- **Monitor life support**: Regular checks catch issues early
- **Electrical inspection**: Annual electrical audit prevents burning smells
- **Waste management**: Empty tanks before full, repair leaks promptly
