# KB-102: Docking Procedure Without Sensors

**Category:** Navigation Systems - Manual Docking
**Difficulty:** Advanced
**Est. Time to Resolve:** 30-90 minutes (docking duration)
**Last Updated:** 2847.09.14

## Issue Description

Proximity sensors (RADAR/LIDAR) have failed or are unavailable, but ship needs to dock at station. Must execute docking maneuver using visual observation and manual control. Requires experienced pilot and careful coordination with station traffic control.

## Importance and Risk

**Proximity sensors normally provide:**
- Accurate range to station (meters)
- Closing velocity (m/s)
- Alignment (pitch, yaw, roll relative to docking port)
- Collision warnings

**Without sensors:**
- Must judge distance visually (human perception less accurate)
- Must calculate closing velocity manually (timing and observation)
- Must align "by eye" (more difficult)
- Higher risk of collision (too fast approach, misalignment)

**Risk Level:**
- **Low risk**: Experienced pilot, good visibility, patient approach
- **Moderate risk**: Less experienced pilot, moderate visibility
- **High risk:** Inexperienced pilot, poor visibility (dark, glare), rushed approach

**Insurance Note:** Many policies require functional sensors for docking. Docking without sensors may void coverage if collision occurs. Document sensor failure and necessity of manual docking.

## When to Attempt Manual Docking

**Attempt manual docking if:**
- Sensors failed but ship otherwise operational
- Alternative docking locations hours or days away
- Crew experienced (pilot has manual docking training)
- Station willing to assist (provide verbal guidance)
- Visibility good (can see station clearly)
- Not time-critical (can take time, do it slowly and carefully)

**Do NOT attempt manual docking if:**
- Pilot inexperienced or uncomfortable
- Visibility poor (fog, debris field, glare from star)
- Station in complex environment (crowded, many ships, hazards)
- Ship has other damage (propulsion issues, control problems)
- Alternative options available (wait for rescue tug, proceed to alternate station)

**Alternative:** Request station send docking tug to capture ship and guide to port (costs 500-2,000 credits but eliminates collision risk)

## Pre-Docking Preparation

### Step 1: Inform Station Traffic Control

**Communication:**

Contact station on approach frequency (usually published, or try standard 123.45 MHz):

> "[STATION NAME] Traffic Control, this is [YOUR SHIP NAME], [REGISTRATION]. We are inbound for docking, but our proximity sensors have failed. Requesting verbal docking assistance and slow approach clearance."

**Station will respond with:**
- Docking port assignment (which port to use)
- Approach path (which direction to approach from)
- Traffic advisories (other ships in area to avoid)
- Offer of verbal guidance ("We'll talk you in")
- May offer tug assistance (if you want to pay for it)

**Confirm:**

> "Roger, [STATION NAME]. We copy docking at Port [NUMBER], approach from [DIRECTION]. We'll take verbal guidance. Proceeding slowly."

**Station expectations:**
- Your approach will be slower than normal (station understands)
- You may need multiple attempts (aborts and retries acceptable)
- Traffic control will monitor and provide distance/velocity reports

---

### Step 2: Brief Crew

**If multi-person crew, assign roles:**

**Pilot:** Flies ship, focuses on controls
**Co-Pilot/Observer:** Watches station, calls out observations ("200 meters, closing at 2 m/s...")
**Communications:** Maintains radio contact with station, relays instructions to pilot
**Engineer (optional):** Monitors propulsion and power, ready to respond to pilot's commands

**Single-pilot operation:**
- Must do all roles (harder)
- Use station traffic control as co-pilot (ask them for distance/velocity reports frequently)
- Take breaks if needed (not a race)

---

### Step 3: Check Ship Systems

**Verify before approach:**

□ **Propulsion:** Thrusters responsive, adequate propellant
□ **RCS (Reaction Control System):** Translation thrusters working (forward, aft, port, starboard, up, down)
□ **Attitude Control:** Pitch, yaw, roll controls responsive
□ **Communications:** Radio clear and functional
□ **Power:** Adequate for extended docking maneuver (may take 2-3x normal time)
□ **Lighting:** Exterior lights ON (station can see you)
□ **Crew:** Everyone briefed, at stations, secured

---

### Step 4: Visual References

**Identify visual cues you'll use for docking:**

**Station Features:**
- Docking port (target): Usually illuminated, may have colored lights
- Station reference lights: Some stations have distance markers (lights at 1km, 500m, 100m intervals)
- Station structure: Use known size to estimate distance (if you know station is 500m diameter, can judge distance by apparent size)

**Orientation Aids:**
- Docking port alignment guides: Many ports have visual alignment indicators (cross-hair pattern, lights that align when ship centered)
- Station rotation: If station rotating, watch rotation rate to match

**Your Ship:**
- Exterior cameras: Use multiple camera angles (forward, side, top-down if available)
- Windows: Direct visual observation (if bridge has windows)
- Range-finding: Some ships have backup optical rangefinder (laser measure distance without full sensor suite)

---

## Manual Docking Procedure

### Phase 1: Initial Approach (10-30 minutes)

**Starting Point:** Several kilometers from station

**Objective:** Reduce distance to 1-2 km, establish stable approach trajectory

**Step 1: Align with Station**

**Visual alignment:**
- Point ship directly at assigned docking port
- Use station as reference (docking port should be in center of view)
- Adjust pitch, yaw, roll until aligned

**Confirmation:**

> "Traffic control, we're aligned on Port [NUMBER]. Can you confirm we're pointed correctly from your view?"

Station may confirm or correct:

> "Affirmative, good alignment" OR "You're 5 degrees high, adjust down slightly"

**Step 2: Initial Approach Burn**

**Thrust:**
- Very gentle forward thrust (1-5% throttle)
- Goal: Closing velocity 5-10 m/s at this distance
- NOT a race, slow is good

**Monitor closing velocity:**
- Visually: Station appears to grow larger
- Timing: Note time between observations, estimate distance change
- Station reports: Ask traffic control: "What's our closing velocity?"

**Step 3: Coast Phase**

**After initial burn:**
- Cut thrust, coast toward station
- Allows time to assess trajectory
- Make small corrections if drifting off course (lateral thrusts)

**Midway check (half distance to station):**
- Verify still aligned (docking port still centered in view)
- Check closing velocity: Aim for 5-10 m/s at several km out

**Corrections:**
- If drifting left: Brief right thruster burst
- If drifting up: Brief down thruster burst
- Re-align and continue coasting

---

### Phase 2: Intermediate Approach (10-20 minutes)

**Range:** 1-2 km to 100-200 meters

**Objective:** Slow approach, precise alignment

**Step 4: Deceleration Burn #1**

**At 1-2 km range:**

> "Traffic control, we're at approximately 1.5 km, closing at [VELOCITY]. Beginning deceleration."

**Thrust:**
- Gentle reverse thrust (aft thrusters)
- Target: Reduce closing velocity to 2-5 m/s
- Burn for several seconds, then coast

**Why slow now:**
- As distance decreases, closing velocity must decrease proportionally
- General rule: Closing velocity (m/s) ≈ Distance (km)
  - At 1 km: Close at 1 m/s (roughly)
  - At 100 m: Close at 0.1 m/s
- Gives time to react if problems develop

**Step 5: Alignment Verification**

**At 500-1000 meters, verify alignment carefully:**

**Visual check:**
- Docking port still centered?
- Ship attitude correct (not tilted relative to station)?
- Any drift (lateral movement)?

**Station confirmation:**

> "Traffic control, at 800 meters, can you verify our alignment?"

Station may provide precise feedback:

> "You're looking good, centered on port. Slight drift to your left, maybe 0.2 m/s lateral. Correct right a bit."

**Make corrections:**
- Small, precise thruster bursts
- Wait after each correction to see effect (don't over-correct)

**Step 6: Rate Check**

**At 500 meters:**

> "Traffic control, what's our range and closing velocity?"

Station responds:

> "You're 500 meters out, closing at 3 m/s."

**Evaluate:**
- 3 m/s at 500m is reasonable (100 seconds to arrival if constant, but will slow further)
- If too fast (>5 m/s): Decelerate more
- If too slow (<1 m/s): May take very long, can speed up slightly if comfortable

---

### Phase 3: Final Approach (10-30 minutes)

**Range:** 100-200 meters to contact

**Objective:** Precision alignment, very slow approach, soft contact

**Step 7: Deceleration Burn #2**

**At 100-200 meters:**

> "Traffic control, final approach. We're at 150 meters."

**Thrust:**
- Reverse thrust to slow to 0.5-1 m/s
- Very gentle (1-2% throttle)
- Monitor station closely (growing larger in view)

**Target velocity:**
- At 100m: 0.5-1 m/s
- At 50m: 0.3-0.5 m/s
- At 20m: 0.2 m/s or less
- At contact: 0.05-0.1 m/s (gentle touch)

**Why so slow:**
- Small misalignment at high speed = damaging collision
- Slow speed allows time to abort if misaligned
- Gentle contact prevents damage to docking collar

**Step 8: Continuous Alignment Corrections**

**At this range, make frequent small corrections:**

**Every 10-20 meters, check:**
- Still centered on docking port?
- Any lateral drift?
- Rotation (roll, pitch, yaw) still correct?

**Corrections:**
- Tiny thruster bursts (0.1-0.5 second pulses)
- Wait 5-10 seconds to see effect
- Correct again if needed

**Visual alignment aids:**
- Many docking ports have cross-hair or alignment lights
- When ship aligned, lights form pattern (e.g., four lights form square)
- When misaligned, pattern distorted

**Example:**

Pilot observes: "Port alignment lights forming X instead of square - we're too high and right."

Correction: Brief down and left thrust, then coast and reassess.

**Step 9: Final Meters**

**At 20 meters:**

> "Traffic control, we're 20 meters out, closing at 0.2 m/s. Looks good?"

Station confirms:

> "Looks good from here. Nice and slow. You're cleared for contact."

**Last 20 meters:**
- No major thrust changes (just fine corrections)
- Watch closing velocity (aim for 0.05-0.1 m/s at contact)
- Verify alignment continuously

**At 10 meters:**
- Can clearly see docking collar (target for contact)
- Should be very slow (<0.1 m/s)
- Any misalignment obvious now (abort if not aligned)

**At 5 meters:**
- Almost there
- Verify rotation: Ship not rotating relative to station
- Very gentle forward drift

**Step 10: Contact**

**Contact occurs when docking collar touches station:**

**Feel/hear:**
- Gentle bump (if done correctly)
- Docking collar mechanisms engage (clamps, seals)
- Ship "captured" by station (held in place)

**Verify successful dock:**
- Green light on docking panel: "DOCKED"
- Pressure in docking tunnel equalizing
- Station confirms: "Hard dock confirmed, welcome to [STATION NAME]"

**Cut thrusters:**
- All thrust to zero
- Station holding ship now, no need for thrust

**Phase 3 Complete:** Docked successfully!

## Abort and Retry

**If at any point approach is not going well:**

### When to Abort

**Abort if:**
- Misalignment >5 degrees and can't correct
- Closing velocity too high (<100m and >1 m/s)
- Lateral drift uncontrollable
- Pilot uncomfortable or uncertain
- Station advises abort ("Negative, you're not aligned, go around")

### Abort Procedure

**Step 1: Announce Abort**

> "Traffic control, we're aborting approach. Coming around for another try."

**Step 2: Reverse Thrust**

- Full reverse thrust to stop forward motion
- Hold until velocity zero or negative (moving away from station)
- Once stopped or moving away: Cut thrust

**Step 3: Clear the Area**

- Move to safe distance (500-1000 meters)
- Re-establish stable position (zero velocity relative to station)
- Assess what went wrong

**Step 4: Prepare for Retry**

- Discuss with crew: What needs to change?
- Confirm with station: Ready for another attempt?
- Restart from Phase 1 or 2 (depending on position)

**Multiple aborts OK:**
- Better to abort 5 times and succeed on 6th than to collide
- Station understands, will be patient
- Take your time

## Special Scenarios

### Scenario A: No Radio (Can't Communicate with Station)

**If communications failed in addition to sensors:**

**Challenges:**
- No verbal guidance from station
- Station may not know your sensors failed
- Cannot coordinate approach

**Procedure:**

1. **Signal with lights:** Flash exterior lights in pattern (SOS: dot-dot-dot, dash-dash-dash, dot-dot-dot)
2. **Very slow approach:** Even slower than normal (assume station doesn't know you're coming)
3. **Watch for station signals:** Station may flash lights back (indicating they see you)
4. **Extremely cautious:** Abort at any sign of uncertainty
5. **Alternative:** Wait outside station at safe distance, hope someone comes to investigate (tug or rescue ship)

---

### Scenario B: Rotating Station

**If station rotates (generates artificial gravity):**

**Challenges:**
- Docking port moving (rotating with station)
- Must match rotation to dock

**Procedure:**

1. **Observe rotation:** Watch station rotate, note rotation rate (e.g., 1 revolution per 60 seconds)
2. **Match rotation:** Rotate ship at same rate (use yaw thrusters to spin ship)
3. **Verify match:** When rotation matched, docking port appears stationary relative to ship
4. **Then dock normally:** Proceed with standard approach once rotation matched

**Tip:** Most rotating stations have non-rotating docking hub (center of rotation). Easier to dock at hub (no rotation matching needed). Ask station if hub docking available.

---

### Scenario C: Poor Visibility

**If visibility reduced (glare from star, darkness, debris field):**

**Challenges:**
- Can't see station or docking port clearly
- Difficult to judge distance and alignment

**Procedure:**

1. **Lighting:** Turn on all exterior lights, ask station to light docking port brightly
2. **Camera filters:** Use camera polarizers or filters to reduce glare
3. **Slower approach:** Even slower to compensate for poor visibility
4. **Station guidance:** Rely heavily on station verbal reports ("You're 200m out, centered, closing at 1 m/s...")
5. **Abort threshold lower:** If can't see clearly at <50m, abort (too risky)

---

### Scenario D: Pilot Fatigue or Stress

**If pilot becoming fatigued or stressed during approach:**

**Signs:**
- Making errors (over-correcting, forgetting steps)
- Shaking hands, sweating
- Tunnel vision (fixated on one thing, missing others)
- Feeling rushed even though not time-critical

**Actions:**

1. **Take a break:** Abort approach, move to safe distance, rest 15-30 minutes
2. **Switch pilots:** If another crew member qualified, let them try
3. **Request tug:** Pay for professional docking assistance rather than risk collision
4. **Acknowledge stress:** It's normal, manual docking is stressful. Better to acknowledge and address than push through and make mistake.

## After Docking

### Step 1: Post-Dock Checks

**After docked, before disembarking:**

□ **Verify hard dock:** Docking panel shows "HARD DOCK" green light
□ **Pressure equalized:** Tunnel pressure matches station (safe to open hatch)
□ **All thrust OFF:** Don't leave thrusters on (wastes fuel, can push against station)
□ **Log dock time:** Ship's log entry (time docked, station name, port number)

### Step 2: Report to Station

> "Traffic control, we're hard-docked at Port [NUMBER]. Thank you for the assistance."

Station confirms:

> "Confirmed hard dock. Welcome to [STATION NAME]. Contact port services for umbilicals and services."

### Step 3: Document Sensor Failure

**For insurance and maintenance records:**

1. **Ship's log:** Note sensor failure, manual docking executed
2. **Maintenance request:** Schedule sensor repair while docked
3. **Insurance notification:** Inform insurance of sensor failure (within 24 hours typically)

### Step 4: Sensor Repair

**While docked, priority repair:**
- Diagnose sensor failure (see KB-067: Proximity Sensors Malfunction)
- Repair or replace sensors
- Test before departure
- Do NOT depart without sensors (very risky to undock manually)

**Undocking without sensors:**
- Possible but even harder than docking (pushing away from massive station, easy to collide)
- Strongly recommend: Repair sensors OR request tug assistance for undock

## Training and Practice

**Manual docking is advanced skill:**

**Training recommendations:**
1. **Simulator practice:** Many stations have docking simulators (paid service, 50-200 credits/hour)
2. **Supervised attempts:** First few manual docks should have experienced pilot supervising
3. **Start easy:** Practice at quiet stations with good visibility before attempting complex docks
4. **Regular practice:** Even with sensors working, practice manual docking quarterly (maintain skill)

**Certification:**
- Some jurisdictions require manual docking certification
- Obtained through training program and practical test
- Check local regulations

---

## Legal and Insurance Considerations

**Manual docking liability:**

**If collision occurs:**
- Pilot may be liable (negligence if not qualified or reckless approach)
- Ship owner may be liable (for damages to station)
- Insurance may not cover if policy requires functional sensors

**Documentation protects you:**
- Ship's log showing sensor failure (not pilot choice to go manual)
- Communication logs with station (station aware and assisted)
- Evidence of careful, slow approach (not reckless)

**Station requirements:**
- Some stations prohibit manual docking (require sensors or tug)
- Check station regulations before attempting
- If prohibited, must use tug even if could dock manually

---

## Cost Comparison

**Manual docking:**
- **Cost:** Free (just time and fuel)
- **Time:** 30-90 minutes (slower than normal)
- **Risk:** Moderate (collision possible if done incorrectly)
- **Skill:** Advanced pilot required

**Tug-assisted docking:**
- **Cost:** 500-2,000 credits (depending on station and ship size)
- **Time:** 20-40 minutes (faster, efficient)
- **Risk:** Very low (professional tug operators, experienced)
- **Skill:** No special pilot skill needed

**Waiting for sensor repair:**
- **Cost:** Variable (depends on repair, may need parts ordered)
- **Time:** Hours to days (if parts not available)
- **Risk:** None (don't dock until sensors fixed)
- **Downside:** Delay reaching station (may have time-sensitive cargo, crew needs)

**Recommendation:** If uncomfortable with manual docking, pay for tug. 1,000 credits is cheaper than collision damage (thousands to millions of credits depending on severity).

**Support Note:** Most customers calling about manual docking are anxious. Reassure them that it's doable with care. Walk through procedure slowly, emphasize "take your time" repeatedly. If customer sounds uncertain or scared, recommend tug assistance rather than risk collision. Better to pay 1,000 credits than damage station (liability can be millions).

**Safety Reminder:** If at any point you're uncertain, abort and try again OR request professional tug. Pride is not worth a collision. Station would rather you abort 10 times than collide once.

**Pilot Skill Assessment:**
- Experienced pilot (>100 docks): High confidence for manual docking
- Moderate pilot (20-100 docks): Doable with caution
- Novice pilot (<20 docks): Recommend tug unless absolutely necessary and supervised

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Slow down:** Can't emphasize enough
2. **Communicate:** Constant updates with station
3. **Abort freely:** Better to try again than crash
4. **Stay calm:** Stress causes errors
5. **Practice:** Skill improves with experience
