# KB-089: Cargo Bay Fire Response

**Category:** Emergency Response - Fire Suppression
**Difficulty:** Intermediate to Advanced
**Est. Time to Resolve:** 10-60 minutes (depending on fire severity)
**Last Updated:** 2847.09.14

## Issue Description

Fire detected in cargo bay. May involve standard cargo, hazardous materials, or both. Requires immediate response to suppress fire, protect crew and ship, and prevent spread. This KB article provides step-by-step response procedures.

## Importance and Urgency

**Fire is one of the most dangerous emergencies aboard a spacecraft:**
- Consumes oxygen (limited resource)
- Produces toxic smoke and gases
- Can damage hull and critical systems
- Can spread rapidly in enclosed spaces
- May involve explosive or toxic materials

**Response time is critical:**
- Small fire: Controllable in 2-5 minutes
- Medium fire: Requires 10-30 minutes, significant damage possible
- Large fire: May require decompression or evacuation

## Fire Classification

**Before suppression, identify fire class** (determines suppression method):

### Class A: Ordinary Combustibles
- **Materials:** Wood, paper, cloth, packaging
- **Characteristics:** Leaves ash, can be re-ignited from embers
- **Suppression:** Water, foam, or multi-purpose extinguisher
- **Common in:** General cargo, crew supplies

### Class B: Flammable Liquids
- **Materials:** Fuel, oil, solvents, grease
- **Characteristics:** Spreads rapidly, floats on water
- **Suppression:** CO₂, foam, or dry chemical (NOT water - spreads fire)
- **Common in:** Industrial chemicals, fuels, lubricants

### Class C: Electrical
- **Materials:** Electrical equipment, wiring, computers
- **Characteristics:** Energized equipment, shock hazard
- **Suppression:** CO₂ or dry chemical (NOT water - electrocution risk)
- **Common in:** Electronics cargo, power distribution areas

### Class D: Combustible Metals
- **Materials:** Magnesium, titanium, sodium, lithium, aluminum powder
- **Characteristics:** Burns extremely hot (>2000°C), reacts with water and CO₂
- **Suppression:** ONLY dry powder (copper, sodium chloride) or smothering (sand)
- **Common in:** Industrial metals, batteries, pyrotechnics

### Class K: Cooking Oils/Fats (Less common on cargo ships)
- **Materials:** Cooking oil, animal fats
- **Suppression:** Wet chemical or foam
- **Common in:** Galley fires (not typically cargo)

**CRITICAL:** Using wrong suppression method can worsen fire (e.g., water on Class D metal fire causes explosion)

## Quick Diagnostic Questions

Ask the customer:

1. **"What's on fire? What type of cargo?"**
   - Determines fire class
   - Identifies hazards (explosives, toxics, etc.)

2. **"How large is the fire?"**
   - Small (< 1 meter): Controllable with extinguisher
   - Medium (1-3 meters): May need multiple extinguishers or suppression system
   - Large (> 3 meters): Consider decompression

3. **"Is the fire spreading?"**
   - Contained: May be controllable
   - Spreading: Urgent action needed

4. **"Is crew safe? Any injuries?"**
   - Crew safety is priority #1
   - Injuries need treatment while fighting fire

5. **"What fire suppression equipment is available?"**
   - Extinguishers: What type (water, CO₂, dry chemical, Class D)?
   - Automatic suppression: Available in this cargo bay?
   - Crew capability: Trained in firefighting?

## Emergency Response Procedure

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (First 60 seconds)

**Critical actions to take immediately:**

**Step 1: Alert Crew (5 seconds)**

> "Activate ship-wide fire alarm immediately. Announce: 'Fire, fire, fire. Cargo Bay [NUMBER]. All hands to fire stations.'"

**Why:** Crew must respond immediately. Every second counts.

**Step 2: Assess Immediate Danger (15 seconds)**

Ask customer:

> "Are you in the cargo bay now? If yes, can you exit safely, or is fire blocking the exit?"

**If crew trapped in bay:**
- **Immediate priority:** Get them out (life over property)
- Alternate exit routes: Other doors, airlocks, emergency hatches
- If no exit: Close doors, seal cracks, await rescue from outside

**If crew outside bay:**
- Good: Crew safe, can fight fire from outside
- Close cargo bay doors (contain fire)

**Step 3: Close Cargo Bay Bulkhead Doors (10 seconds)**

> "Close all doors to the cargo bay immediately. Do NOT enter bay until you have suppression equipment ready."

**Why:**
- Isolates fire (prevents spread to rest of ship)
- Reduces oxygen supply to fire (slows growth)
- Protects crew from smoke and heat

**Step 4: Cut Power to Cargo Bay (10 seconds)**

> "If fire involves electrical equipment, cut power to the cargo bay. Circuit breaker panel, switch labeled CARGO BAY POWER."

**Why:**
- Eliminates electrical ignition source
- Prevents electrical shock when using water (if applicable)
- May stop fire if electrical source

**Step 5: Verify Crew Accounted For (20 seconds)**

> "Confirm all crew are accounted for and safe. Is anyone missing or in the cargo bay?"

**If anyone missing:**
- Locate them (communications, last known position)
- Rescue if safe to do so
- Do NOT send rescuer alone (two-person minimum for safety)

**Phase 1 Complete:** Fire contained, crew safe, ready for suppression

---

### Phase 2: Fire Assessment and Suppression Planning (1-3 minutes)

**Step 6: Gather Information**

**Ask customer:**

> "Tell me everything you can see or know about the fire:"

**Information needed:**
- Fire location in bay (forward, aft, port, starboard, near door?)
- Cargo involved (what's burning?)
- Fire size (describe in meters or "small/medium/large")
- Smoke color:
  - White/gray: Normal combustion (Class A)
  - Black: Petroleum products (Class B)
  - Yellow/brown: Chemicals or plastics (toxic)
  - Bright/sparking: Metal fire (Class D)
- Flames visible or just smoke?
- Spreading or contained?

**Step 7: Identify Fire Class**

Based on cargo manifest and customer description:

**Class A (ordinary combustibles):**
- Cargo: Paper, cardboard, wood, textiles
- Suppression: Water or foam

**Class B (flammable liquids):**
- Cargo: Fuel, oil, solvents, chemicals
- Suppression: CO₂, foam, or dry chemical

**Class C (electrical):**
- Cargo: Electronics, batteries, appliances
- Suppression: CO₂ or dry chemical (cut power first)

**Class D (metals):**
- Cargo: Magnesium, titanium, metal powders
- Suppression: Class D dry powder ONLY (copper or sodium chloride)
- **DO NOT use water or CO₂ (explosive reaction)**

**Class ABC (general cargo, mixed):**
- If unsure or mixed cargo: Use ABC multipurpose extinguisher

**Step 8: Select Suppression Method**

**Option A: Handheld Fire Extinguisher(s)**

**Use when:**
- Fire small to medium (< 3 meters)
- Fire class known and appropriate extinguisher available
- Crew trained and able to approach fire safely

**Advantages:**
- Quick deployment
- Precise application
- Minimal collateral damage

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited capacity (30-60 seconds discharge time per extinguisher)
- Requires crew to enter bay (risk)
- May need multiple extinguishers for large fire

**Extinguisher Types:**
- Water (Class A): Red label, spray nozzle
- CO₂ (Class B, C): Black label, horn nozzle
- Dry Chemical ABC (Class A, B, C): Yellow label, most versatile
- Class D (Metals): Special purple label, rare, may not be aboard

**Proceed to Phase 3A**

---

**Option B: Automatic Suppression System (CO₂ Flood)**

**Use when:**
- Fire medium to large
- Cargo bay equipped with automatic system
- Fire class A, B, or C (NOT Class D metals)
- Crew cannot safely approach fire

**Advantages:**
- Floods entire bay (no crew entry needed)
- Very effective for enclosed spaces
- Crew stays safe outside

**Disadvantages:**
- Displaces oxygen (anyone in bay will suffocate)
- Ineffective on Class D metal fires (metals burn without oxygen)
- May damage sensitive cargo (cold from CO₂)
- One-time use (must refill system after)

**Proceed to Phase 3B**

---

**Option C: Cargo Bay Decompression (Vent to Space)**

**Use when:**
- Fire large and uncontrollable
- Other methods failed or unavailable
- Willing to sacrifice all cargo in bay
- Bay can be safely depressurized

**Advantages:**
- Most effective (fire cannot burn without atmosphere)
- No crew exposure to fire
- Removes smoke and toxic gases

**Disadvantages:**
- Destroys or ejects ALL cargo in bay (total loss)
- Damages bay interior (extreme cold, vacuum)
- Structural stress on bay door
- Slow re-pressurization (30-60 minutes)

**Proceed to Phase 3C**

---

**Option D: Abandon and Isolate**

**Use when:**
- Fire too dangerous to approach
- No suppression systems available
- Crew not trained or equipped
- Fire contained within bay

**Actions:**
- Seal cargo bay completely
- Monitor from outside (temperature, pressure)
- Allow fire to burn out (consumes available oxygen, self-extinguishes)
- May take 30-120 minutes

**Disadvantages:**
- Cargo destroyed
- Bay damaged by heat
- Slow (waiting for burnout)

**Only if other options not viable**

---

### Phase 3A: Manual Suppression with Extinguishers (5-20 minutes)

**Preparation:**

1. **Gather Equipment** (1-2 minutes)
   - Fire extinguishers: At least 2 (appropriate class)
   - Protective gear: Heat-resistant gloves, goggles
   - Pressure suit or breathing apparatus (if smoke heavy)
   - Communication: Radios for team coordination

2. **Assemble Team** (1 minute)
   - Minimum 2 crew (firefighter + backup)
   - Roles:
     - Firefighter 1: Operates extinguisher, approaches fire
     - Firefighter 2: Backup extinguisher, watches Firefighter 1, ready to assist or rescue
     - Captain/Coordinator: Outside bay, monitors, coordinates

3. **Plan Approach** (1 minute)
   - Entry point: Which door provides best access?
   - Escape route: Ensure clear path to exit
   - Wind/airflow: Position upwind if possible (smoke blows away from you)
   - Attack angle: Approach fire from side or front, not from behind (heat and smoke)

**Execution:**

**Step 9: Open Cargo Bay Door (Carefully)**

> "Firefighters ready with extinguishers. Open cargo bay door slowly. If heavy smoke or flames rush out, close door immediately and switch to automatic suppression."

**Assess:**
- Smoke level: Light (can see), moderate (low visibility), heavy (zero visibility)
- Heat: Warm (tolerable), hot (uncomfortable), extreme (cannot approach)
- Fire size: Verify earlier estimate

**If conditions too dangerous:** Abort manual suppression, use automatic system or decompression

**Step 10: Apply Extinguisher**

**PASS Technique:**
- **P**ull: Pull pin from extinguisher
- **A**im: Aim nozzle at BASE of fire (not flames, but fuel source)
- **S**queeze: Squeeze handle to discharge
- **S**weep: Sweep nozzle side-to-side, covering base of fire

**Instructions for customer:**

> "Pull the pin from your extinguisher. Aim the nozzle at the base of the fire, not the flames. Stay about 2-3 meters back. Squeeze the handle and sweep side to side. Keep your escape route behind you."

**Monitor discharge:**
- Extinguisher discharge time: 10-60 seconds (depending on size)
- If fire not suppressed when extinguisher empty: Use second extinguisher immediately
- Firefighter 1 steps back, Firefighter 2 moves forward with fresh extinguisher

**Step 11: Verify Fire Suppressed**

> "Once flames are out, check for hot spots. Use thermal camera or feel carefully (don't touch directly). Look for smoldering embers, glowing materials, or reignition."

**Hot spot check:**
- Scan burned area with thermal camera (if available)
- Look for smoke still rising (indicates smoldering)
- Check nearby cargo (heat may have spread)

**If hot spots found:**
- Apply more extinguisher or water (if Class A)
- Separate hot cargo from surrounding materials
- Monitor for 15 minutes to ensure no reignition

**Step 12: Ventilate and Clean Up**

> "Open cargo bay vents or use fans to clear smoke. Do NOT breathe smoke - use breathing apparatus or wait for ventilation. Check crew for smoke inhalation."

**Ventilation time:** 15-30 minutes (depending on bay size and ventilation system)

**Phase 3A Complete:** Fire suppressed manually

---

### Phase 3B: Automatic CO₂ Suppression (10-30 minutes)

**Preparation:**

**Step 9: Verify Bay Sealed and Crew Clear**

> "Confirm all doors to cargo bay are closed and sealed. Confirm NO ONE is inside the bay. CO₂ suppression will remove oxygen - anyone inside will suffocate."

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All doors closed
- [ ] Crew count verified (all accounted for, none in bay)
- [ ] Adjacent compartments sealed (prevent CO₂ spreading)

**Step 10: Activate CO₂ Flood System**

**Location:** Cargo bay suppression control panel (usually outside bay, near door)

**Activation procedure:**

> "Open the suppression panel cover. You'll see a red button labeled CARGO BAY CO₂ SUPPRESSION. Press and HOLD for 3 seconds. You'll hear an alarm warning that suppression is activating."

**System activates:**
- Warning alarm: 30-second countdown (last chance to abort if someone in bay)
- CO₂ release: System floods bay with CO₂ (displaces oxygen)
- Discharge time: 60-90 seconds (fills bay completely)

**What customer will observe:**

> "You'll hear a loud whooshing sound as CO₂ releases. This is normal. Temperature may drop (CO₂ is very cold, around -78°C). Do NOT open doors during discharge."

**Step 11: Monitor from Outside**

**Monitoring period:** 5-10 minutes after discharge complete

> "Wait 10 minutes after discharge completes. Monitor cargo bay temperature (should drop as fire suppressed). If temperature starts rising again, fire may have re-ignited."

**Monitor indicators:**
- Bay temperature: Should decrease then stabilize
- Pressure: Should be normal (CO₂ replaces air, doesn't increase pressure much)
- Smoke: Should stop (visible through windows if equipped)

**Step 12: Ventilate Bay**

> "After 10 minutes, activate cargo bay ventilation to purge CO₂. This will take 15-20 minutes. Do NOT enter until ventilation complete - CO₂ is still present and will suffocate crew."

**Ventilation procedure:**
- Open bay vents to space (vents CO₂)
- Or use ventilation system to replace CO₂ with fresh air
- Monitor O₂ level: Must be >19% before entry safe

**Step 13: Inspect and Confirm**

> "Once bay re-oxygenated, crew can enter (with breathing apparatus as precaution) to inspect. Check for any remaining fire or hot spots."

**Inspection:**
- Thermal scan of bay
- Check cargo for smoldering
- Verify fire completely extinguished
- Document damage for insurance

**Phase 3B Complete:** Fire suppressed by automatic system

---

### Phase 3C: Emergency Decompression (30-90 minutes)

**Last resort when fire cannot be controlled by other means**

**Preparation:**

**Step 9: Decision Confirmation**

**Confirm with customer:**

> "Decompression will destroy or eject all cargo in the bay. This is a total loss. Are you certain you want to proceed? Is there no other option?"

**Only proceed if:**
- Fire large and spreading despite suppression attempts
- Risk to ship or crew if fire not stopped
- Customer accepts total cargo loss

**Step 10: Secure Adjacent Compartments**

> "Close and seal all bulkheads adjacent to cargo bay. Verify they are airtight. Decompression will create pressure differential - we don't want it spreading."

**Verify:**
- All doors to bay closed and locked
- Crew in safe compartments away from bay
- Emergency gear ready (in case hull stress causes issues)

**Step 11: Open Cargo Bay Outer Door**

**Control location:** Bridge or cargo bay control panel

> "Access cargo bay controls. You should see a control for the outer cargo door. This is normally used for loading/unloading in vacuum. Select OPEN OUTER DOOR. System will warn you that bay is pressurized - confirm you want to proceed."

**System warnings:**
- "WARNING: Bay pressurized. Opening outer door will cause rapid decompression."
- Confirm: YES

**Step 12: Decompression Event**

**What happens:**
- Outer door begins opening (10-30 seconds to fully open)
- Air rushes out of bay to space (rapid decompression)
- Pressure drops from 101 kPa to 0 in 30-60 seconds
- Loose cargo may be ejected (sucked out by escaping air)
- Fire extinguished (no oxygen)
- Temperature drops rapidly to -200°C (space environment)

**What customer will experience:**

> "You'll hear a loud roaring sound as air escapes (even outside bay, through hull). Ship may shudder slightly. This is normal. Sound will decrease as pressure equalizes. Total time about 1 minute."

**Monitor from bridge:**
- Bay pressure gauge: Drops to zero
- Hull stress sensors: May show elevated stress (watch for warnings)
- External cameras: Can see cargo door open, any ejected cargo

**Step 13: Close Outer Door and Assess**

> "Once bay fully decompressed (pressure at zero), close the outer cargo door. Fire is extinguished. Now we need to assess damage and plan recovery."

**Recovery steps:**
- Inspect bay door mechanism (may be damaged by stress)
- Check hull integrity (ensure no cracks from pressure stress)
- Allow bay to warm slightly (wait 30-60 minutes)
- Re-pressurize bay slowly (prevents further stress)
- Inspect cargo and bay (document total loss)

**Phase 3C Complete:** Fire extinguished by decompression (cargo lost)

---

### Phase 4: Post-Fire Actions (30-120 minutes)

**After fire suppressed by any method:**

**Step 14: Verify Fire Completely Extinguished**

> "Before leaving the bay, verify there are no hot spots, smoldering materials, or re-ignition risk. Use thermal camera to scan entire bay."

**Hot spot temperature threshold:**
- <100°C: Safe (ambient or warm)
- 100-200°C: Caution (monitor, may re-ignite)
- >200°C: Danger (still burning or likely to re-ignite, more suppression needed)

**Step 15: Treat Injuries**

**Check crew for:**
- Smoke inhalation: Coughing, difficulty breathing, dizziness
  - Treatment: Fresh air, oxygen, rest
  - Severe: Medical evacuation
- Burns: Redness, blisters, charred skin
  - Treatment: Cool water (Class A burns), dry bandage, pain relief
  - Severe (>10% body area or 3rd degree): Medical evacuation
- Heat exhaustion: Weakness, nausea, rapid heartbeat
  - Treatment: Cool environment, hydration, rest

**If serious injuries:** Call medical emergency frequency (121.6 MHz)

**Step 16: Isolate and Secure Bay**

> "Do not use the cargo bay until it's been fully inspected and cleaned. Lock the doors, post signage: FIRE DAMAGE - DO NOT ENTER."

**Why:**
- Structural damage may be unsafe
- Toxic residue from burned materials
- Insurance inspection required before cleanup

**Step 17: Document Incident**

**Required documentation:**

1. **Incident Report:**
   - Time of fire detection, suppression, and extinguishment
   - Fire location, size, and class
   - Cargo involved (manifest references)
   - Suppression method used
   - Crew involved and any injuries
   - Damage assessment (preliminary)

2. **Photos/Video:**
   - Fire damage (before cleanup)
   - Damaged cargo
   - Suppression system used
   - Any hull or structural damage

3. **Ship's Log Entry:**
   - Official record of incident
   - Captain's narrative

4. **Notifications:**
   - Insurance company (within 24 hours)
   - Cargo owner (if not ship owner)
   - Port authority (destination or nearest)
   - ORSM (if equipment failure contributed)

**Step 18: Investigate Root Cause**

**Common fire causes:**
- Electrical short (cargo or bay wiring)
- Friction/heat from cargo shifting
- Spontaneous combustion (reactive chemicals)
- Crew error (welding sparks, improper storage)
- Equipment malfunction (heater, light fixture)

**Investigation:**
- Examine burn pattern (where fire started)
- Check cargo manifest (any incompatible materials stored together?)
- Review loading procedures (was cargo secured properly?)
- Inspect electrical (any damaged wiring or equipment?)
- Interview crew (did anyone see or hear anything before fire?)

**Goal:** Identify cause to prevent recurrence

**Step 19: Preventive Actions**

**Based on root cause, implement preventive measures:**

**If electrical:** Inspect and repair wiring, upgrade circuit protection
**If cargo shifting:** Improve tie-down procedures, training
**If incompatible materials:** Review cargo acceptance procedures, enforce separation requirements
**If spontaneous combustion:** Revise hazmat storage procedures, temperature monitoring
**If equipment:** Replace faulty equipment, improve maintenance schedule

**Step 20: Cleanup and Repair**

**After all investigations and documentation:**

1. **Remove damaged cargo:**
   - Inventory (for insurance claim)
   - Dispose properly (especially hazmat)

2. **Clean bay:**
   - Remove soot, ash, suppression agent residue
   - Wash surfaces if chemical residue
   - Air out (ventilate thoroughly)

3. **Repair damage:**
   - Hull plating (if heat-damaged)
   - Electrical wiring
   - Cargo securing points
   - Suppression system (refill CO₂, replace extinguishers)
   - Paint and finishes

4. **Inspection before return to service:**
   - Professional inspection (if major fire)
   - Test all bay systems
   - Load test (verify structural integrity)

**Time estimate:**
- Minor fire cleanup: 4-8 hours
- Major fire cleanup and repair: 2-7 days
- Decompression recovery: 3-5 days (includes door mechanism inspection, re-pressurization, full inspection)

## Special Scenarios

### Scenario A: Hazmat Fire (Toxic Smoke)

**If cargo includes chemicals producing toxic smoke:**

**Additional precautions:**
- Crew must use breathing apparatus (not just masks)
- Ventilation to exterior only (do NOT vent toxic smoke into ship)
- Decontamination after firefighting (wash gear, shower)
- Medical monitoring (some toxins cause delayed symptoms)

**Common toxic cargoes:**
- Plastics: Produce hydrogen cyanide (HCN) when burning
- Chlorinated compounds: Produce phosgene or chlorine gas
- Sulfur compounds: Produce sulfur dioxide (corrosive)

**If severe toxicity:** Consider decompression (removes toxins completely)

---

### Scenario B: Oxygen-Enriched Atmosphere

**If cargo bay had elevated O₂ level (>23%) before fire:**

**Danger:**
- Fire burns MUCH faster and hotter
- Materials that normally don't burn (metals, plastics) may ignite
- Explosion risk

**Actions:**
- Do NOT enter bay (flash fire risk)
- Use automatic suppression only (CO₂ flood or decompression)
- Allow extra time for suppression (fire more intense)

---

### Scenario C: Explosion Risk

**If cargo includes explosives, propellants, or pressurized containers:**

**Danger:**
- Fire may cause explosion (catastrophic)
- Pressurized containers may rupture (shrapnel)

**Actions:**
- Evacuate crew from adjacent compartments
- Suppress fire as quickly as possible (extinguisher or CO₂ flood)
- If fire cannot be suppressed quickly: Decompress bay (removes heat and oxygen before explosion)

**Signs of imminent explosion:**
- Loud hissing or creaking (containers heating up)
- Bulging walls or cargo (pressure buildup)
- Flames changing color (indicating chemical reaction accelerating)

**If explosion imminent:** Evacuate immediately, seal bulkheads, brace for impact

---

## Prevention Tips

**Preventing cargo bay fires (include in post-incident report):**

1. **Proper cargo storage:**
   - Separate incompatible materials (oxidizers away from fuels)
   - Secure cargo (prevent shifting and friction)
   - Appropriate temperature (some chemicals ignite if too hot)

2. **Electrical safety:**
   - Inspect cargo bay wiring quarterly
   - Do not overload circuits (heaters, lights, etc.)
   - Repair damaged wiring immediately

3. **Smoking/ignition source prohibition:**
   - No smoking in cargo bays (enforce strictly)
   - No welding or hot work without fire watch and precautions
   - Ground static electricity (especially when handling flammables)

4. **Fire detection:**
   - Smoke detectors in all cargo bays (test monthly)
   - Thermal monitoring (especially for spontaneous combustion risk)
   - Regular bay inspections

5. **Fire suppression equipment:**
   - Extinguishers appropriate for cargo types
   - Automatic suppression systems maintained and tested
   - Crew trained in firefighting (quarterly drills)

6. **Hazmat procedures:**
   - Proper declaration of hazmat (never accept undeclared hazmat)
   - Hazmat-rated containers and restraints
   - Temperature and atmosphere monitoring for reactive materials

---

## Escalation Criteria

**Escalate to emergency support if:**

- Fire out of control despite suppression attempts
- Crew injuries severe
- Explosion risk
- Fire threatening critical systems (reactor, life support, bridge)
- Customer uncomfortable making suppression decisions
- Uncertainty about cargo hazards (unknown chemicals, undeclared hazmat)

**Emergency frequency:** 121.7 MHz (ORSM Emergency Support) or 121.5 MHz (Rescue Coordination)

**Critical Reminder:** Fire aboard spacecraft is extremely dangerous. When in doubt, err on side of caution: use automatic suppression or decompression rather than risk crew. Cargo can be replaced; crew cannot. Act quickly, but think clearly. Follow procedures systematically.

**Support Note:** Most cargo fires start small and are controllable with extinguisher IF caught early. Key is quick detection and response. Walk customer through assessment carefully - correct fire classification is critical (wrong suppression method makes fire worse). If customer hesitant or scared, recommend automatic system or professional response rather than manual firefighting. Safety first, always.
