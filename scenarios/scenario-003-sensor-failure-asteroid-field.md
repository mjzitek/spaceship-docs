**Scenario ID:** SCENARIO-003
**Category:** Navigation Emergency / Sensor Systems
**Difficulty Level:** Advanced
**Training Purpose:** Complex emergency response, improvisation, multiple system coordination
**Estimated Duration:** 45-60 minutes
**Last Updated:** 2847.09.14

## Scenario Overview

**Situation**: A mining vessel has suffered catastrophic sensor failure while navigating through a dense asteroid field. The ship must exit the field safely using limited backup systems and external assistance while avoiding collision with tumbling asteroids and debris.

**Primary Learning Objectives**:
1. Managing sensor system failure during critical navigation
2. Using backup and improvised detection methods
3. Coordinating with external assistance
4. Making risk assessments under time pressure
5. Prioritizing repairs during emergencies

**Secondary Learning Objectives**:
- Communication under stress
- Creative problem-solving with limited resources
- Managing crew fear/panic
- Decision-making with incomplete information

## Initial Setup

### Vessel Profile

**Ship**: Mining hauler "Prospector's Dream"
**Class**: Medium industrial vessel (CMS-Standard)
**Crew**: 6 (Captain, Pilot, Engineer, 2 Miners, Maintenance Tech)
**Cargo**: 180 tons of processed ore (properly secured)
**Location**: Kalvari Asteroid Belt, approximately 15 km into dense region
**Status**: En route to processing station after 3-week mining operation

**Systems Status (Before Incident)**:
- All systems nominal
- Sensors: SAS-Standard (100% functional)
- Navigation: Plotting course through belt, 45 minutes to clear field
- Power: Q-Core at 65% capacity
- Life Support: Normal
- Hull: Minor wear from mining operations but intact

### Asteroid Field Characteristics

**Field Density**: High (average 2-5 asteroids >10m per cubic km)
**Asteroid Sizes**: 1m to 500m diameter
**Composition**: Primarily rock and metal
**Hazards**:
- Tumbling asteroids (unpredictable motion)
- Debris clouds from collisions
- Irregular shapes (difficult to detect)
- Some asteroids with metallic content (radar reflective)

### Triggering Event

**T+0:00** - Micro-meteoroid storm strikes vessel

The ship encounters an unexpected micro-meteoroid swarm (1mm to 10mm particles traveling at high velocity):
- Hull takes thousands of micro-impacts (sounds like heavy rain on metal)
- External sensor arrays directly hit
- Electrical surge from impacts damages sensor computer
- Multiple sensor elements destroyed or damaged

## Scenario Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Failure (T+0:00 to T+0:05)

**T+0:00** - Impact begins
- Loud rattling/pinging sounds throughout hull
- Crew startled, immediate alarm

**T+0:15** - Sensor alarms trigger
- Multiple sensor error codes appear
- Displays flicker then go dark or show errors
- E-SENS-600: Multiple Sensor Systems Offline

**T+0:30** - Pilot realizes sensors dead
- Navigation display blank
- Tactical display showing errors
- No radar, no lidar, no optical feed

**T+1:00** - Impacts cease
- Storm passed (was brief but intense)
- Damage assessment begins

**T+2:00** - Engineer reports sensor status
- Radar array: 60% elements damaged (insufficient for operation)
- Optical telescopes: Lenses cracked/destroyed, motors jammed with debris
- Lidar: Transmitter offline
- Graviton detector: Offline (power supply damaged)
- Sensor computer: Multiple errors, rebooting failed

**Current Situation**:
- Vessel is essentially blind
- Moving at 50 m/s through dense asteroid field
- Nearest clear space: ~30 km ahead (at current speed = 10 minutes)
- Cannot see asteroids until potentially too late

**Customer (Captain) Initial Call**:
```
"Support, this is mining hauler Prospector's Dream. We've got a major problem.
Just hit a meteoroid storm and our sensors are gone—completely dead. We're
blind in the middle of the Kalvari field doing 50 meters per second. I can
see a few asteroids out the viewport but not enough to navigate safely. We
need help NOW or we're going to hit something!"
```

### Support Agent Actions - Phase 1

**Immediate Assessment Questions**:
1. Confirm current velocity and heading
2. How many asteroids visible through viewports?
3. What sensors (if any) still partially functional?
4. Crew status and injuries?
5. Hull integrity after impacts?
6. Any other vessels in the area?

**Immediate Guidance**:
1. **Reduce speed immediately** (priority 1)
   - Cut main engines to 20% thrust
   - Don't stop completely (need some steerage)
   - Reduces collision impact energy and gives more reaction time

2. **Visual observation protocol**
   - Post crew at all viewports
   - Use binoculars if available
   - Call out asteroids: bearing, distance, size
   - Pilot notes positions manually

3. **Attempt sensor recovery**
   - Engineer to assess what might be quickly fixable
   - Sensor computer hard reboot
   - Check for blown fuses/breakers

4. **Communication**
   - Broadcast on emergency frequency (any nearby ships?)
   - Contact nearest station for assistance

**Expected Captain Response**:
"Understood, cutting speed to minimum. We've got crew at the windows now—seeing
asteroids all around us, some passing within 100 meters. Hull integrity is
holding, just surface damage. No other ships on comms... wait, station says
they might have a patrol ship in the area. Engineer says sensor computer is
fried, might take hours to repair."

### Phase 2: Improvised Navigation (T+0:05 to T+0:20)

**Available Resources Discovered**:

1. **Partial visual navigation**
   - Forward viewport gives 60° field of view
   - Side viewports give additional coverage
   - Can see asteroids illuminated by distant star
   - Cannot see "behind" asteroid (shadow zones)

2. **Emergency backup rangefinder**
   - Handheld laser rangefinder in emergency kit
   - Range: 5 km
   - Requires manual aiming
   - One measurement at a time (slow)

3. **Ship's communications**
   - EM radio still functional
   - Can detect radio reflections (crude radar substitute)
   - Transmit signal, listen for reflections
   - Very imprecise but indicates "something nearby"

4. **Portable motion detector**
   - Maintenance tech has portable motion sensor
   - Detects movement within 500m
   - Battery powered
   - Used normally for finding equipment in cargo bay

5. **External assistance available**
   - Patrol ship "Sentinel" 40 km away
   - Has full sensors
   - Can reach Prospector's Dream in 20 minutes
   - Can provide sensor guidance via radio

**Support Agent Challenge Points**:

**Challenge 1: Choosing Navigation Strategy**

Three options presented to captain:

**Option A: "Dead Stop and Wait for Rescue"**
- Stop engines completely
- Drift in place
- Wait for patrol ship Sentinel to arrive (20 min)
- Sentinel uses sensors to guide them out

*Advantages*: Safest, no collision risk while stopped
*Disadvantages*: Drifting with residual velocity, may hit asteroid while waiting
*Risk*: Medium

**Option B: "Slow Visual Navigation"**
- Reduce to 10 m/s
- Crew watches for asteroids visually
- Manual steering based on visual calls
- Use backup rangefinder for critical distance checks

*Advantages*: Maintains control, can avoid visible threats
*Disadvantages*: Can't see all asteroids, very slow, stressful for crew
*Risk*: Medium-High

**Option C: "Guided Navigation via Sentinel"**
- Continue at reduced speed (30 m/s)
- Sentinel provides sensor data via radio
- Pilot follows Sentinel's instructions
- Faster escape from field

*Advantages*: Faster exit, professional sensor guidance
*Disadvantages*: Communication lag, trust external party, still risky
*Risk*: Medium

**Support Agent Task**: Help captain evaluate options and choose appropriate strategy.

**Expected Customer Response** (varies based on support guidance):
"I think we'll try Option C—guided navigation with Sentinel. We can't just sit
here drifting blind, and I trust a patrol ship's sensors more than our eyeballs.
How do we coordinate with them?"

### Phase 3: Coordinated Navigation (T+0:20 to T+0:40)

**Coordination with Patrol Ship Sentinel**

**Sentinel arrives on scene** (T+0:20):
```
SENTINEL: "Prospector's Dream, this is patrol ship Sentinel. We have you on
sensors. Reading 37 asteroids within 2 km of your position. Your current
heading is good for the next 500 meters, but you'll need course correction
after that. Ready to receive navigation guidance?"
```

**Guidance Protocol Established**:
1. Sentinel scans ahead on Prospector's course
2. Identifies safe path through asteroids
3. Provides steering commands every 30 seconds
4. Prospector acknowledges and executes

**Complications That Arise**:

**Complication 1: Communication Lag** (T+0:25)
```
CAPTAIN: "Support, there's a 2-second lag on radio communications with
Sentinel. They tell us to turn, we respond, they confirm—by the time we
execute we've moved 60 meters. This is getting tight!"
```

**Support Agent Task**: Suggest solutions to communication lag issue
- Sentinel provides instructions further ahead
- Continuous course projection (not discrete commands)
- Prospector anticipates commands based on asteroid positions
- Reduce speed further to allow more time per command

**Complication 2: Sensor Ghost** (T+0:30)
```
SENTINEL: "Warning, large object detected 400 meters ahead, 20 degrees port.
Recommend immediate starboard turn."

CAPTAIN: "We don't see anything out the viewport in that direction. It's
clear! Are you sure?"

SENTINEL: "Sensors show... wait, contact fading. Might be a ghost or debris
cloud. Disregard, maintain heading."

CAPTAIN: "Support, can we trust their sensors? What if they see ghosts and
we maneuver into a real asteroid?"
```

**Support Agent Task**: Help captain navigate trust and verification issues
- Use visual confirmation when possible
- Sentinel should indicate confidence level in contacts
- Cross-check with multiple sensor types on Sentinel
- Balance between trusting guidance and visual verification

**Complication 3: Close Call** (T+0:35)
```
SENTINEL: "EMERGENCY! Asteroid 150 meters directly ahead, you're on collision
course! Hard to port NOW!"

CAPTAIN: "Turning hard port— [loud impact sound] —we clipped it! Glancing
blow, hull integrity holding, but we're tumbling! Trying to stabilize!"
```

**Support Agent Task**: Guide recovery from tumbling
1. Cut main engines immediately (prevent uncontrolled acceleration)
2. Use RCS (reaction control system) to counter spin
3. Stabilize attitude before resuming transit
4. Check hull damage
5. Verify all systems still functional

**Expected Customer Response**:
"Okay, we're stable now. That was close—hull took a hit on the port bow,
pressure holding but we've got a dent. No critical damage. Slowing to 20 m/s,
this is too dangerous at higher speed."

### Phase 4: Final Navigation and Repair Planning (T+0:40 to T+1:00)

**Approaching Clear Space** (T+0:45)
```
SENTINEL: "Good news, Prospector. You're 5 km from the field edge. Density
dropping. Should be clear space in about 4 minutes at current speed."
```

**Captain Focus Shifts to Repairs**:
```
CAPTAIN: "Support, we're almost out, but we need to get sensors back online
before we can continue to the station. What's the quickest way to restore
at least partial sensor capability? Engineer says the radar array is mostly
destroyed, optical systems jammed, computers fried. This is bad."
```

**Support Agent Task**: Triage sensor repair options

**Minimum Viable Sensors for Station Navigation**:
- Need at least basic ranging (lidar or radar)
- Need docking guidance sensors
- Don't need full tactical suite for station approach

**Quick Repair Options**:

**Option 1: Restore Lidar** (estimated 30 min)
- Lidar transmitter offline, possibly fixable
- Check power supply and fuses
- May be repairable without replacement parts
- Provides precision ranging for docking

**Option 2: Jury-Rig Radar** (estimated 2 hours)
- 60% of radar elements destroyed
- Remaining 40% might provide limited function
- Rewire surviving elements
- Severely reduced range and accuracy but functional

**Option 3: Portable Sensor Package** (if available)
- Sentinel might have portable sensor buoy
- Attach to Prospector's hull temporarily
- Provides basic detection capability
- Can use until permanent repairs at station

**Option 4: Sentinel Escort to Station** (no repair needed)
- Patrol ship guides them all the way to station
- Relies entirely on external guidance
- Slow but safe
- Sentinel may need to leave for other duties

**Support Agent Task**: Help captain choose repair strategy based on:
- Available tools and parts
- Crew technical skill
- Time constraints
- Risk tolerance

**Expected Customer Response**:
"Engineer thinks he can get the lidar working in 30-45 minutes. We'll park
in clear space just outside the field and make the repair. Sentinel can
stand by in case we need guidance to the station. Once lidar is up, we
should be able to dock safely."

### Phase 5: Resolution (T+1:00+)

**Repair Attempt**:
```
CAPTAIN: "Support, engineer is making progress. Found a blown fuse and a
disconnected power cable—both from the meteoroid impacts. Replacing fuse now...
lidar's powering up... we've got a rangefinder! Reading distance to Sentinel:
3.2 km. It works!"
```

**Final Status**:
- Lidar operational (basic ranging available)
- Can navigate to station safely with limited sensors
- Will need full sensor array replacement at station
- Crew safe, vessel functional

**Captain's Final Statement**:
```
"Support, thank you. That was the most terrifying hour of my career. We made
it out with your help and Sentinel's guidance. Heading to the station now
for proper repairs. I'm filing a hazard report about that meteoroid storm—
other miners need to know about it. Prospector's Dream out."
```
