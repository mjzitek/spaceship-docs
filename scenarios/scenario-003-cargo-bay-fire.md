# TRAIN-CARGO-003: Cargo Bay Fire with Hazmat Involvement

**Training Module:** Cargo Operations - Fire Safety
**Difficulty:** Advanced
**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Prerequisites:** EMERG-006 (Fire Suppression), Cargo Handling Certification
**Last Updated:** 2847.09.14

## Scenario Overview

**Situation**: Mid-flight between stations, cargo bay fire involving Class 4.1 Flammable Solids (industrial magnesium powder). Fire detected by thermal sensors in Cargo Bay 2. Crew must suppress fire without catastrophic reaction, protect adjacent cargo, and prevent hull damage.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Recognize hazmat fire characteristics and dangers
- Execute appropriate fire suppression for chemical fires
- Manage cargo bay decompression as fire suppression method
- Coordinate damage control with limited crew
- Make critical decisions under time pressure

**Ship Configuration:**
- Model: Frontier-Class Medium Freighter
- Crew: 4 (Captain, Engineer, Cargo Specialist, Pilot)
- Location: Deep space, 3 days from nearest station
- Cargo Manifest:
  - Bay 1: Agricultural equipment (safe)
  - Bay 2: 4 tons magnesium powder in 200kg drums (Class 4.1 - FIRE SOURCE)
  - Bay 3: Pressurized deuterium tanks for resale (Class 2.1 - SECONDARY HAZARD)
  - Bay 4: Electronics (water-sensitive, expensive)

## Initial Conditions (T+0:00)

**Time**: 14:22 ship time
**Status**: Routine transit, crew at duty stations

**Alarm Triggers:**
- Cargo Bay 2 thermal sensor: Temperature spike from 18°C to 220°C in 30 seconds
- Smoke detector: Particulate density exceeding threshold
- Fire suppression system: Auto-activation standby (awaiting crew confirmation)

**Bridge Display:**
```
FIRE ALERT - CARGO BAY 2
Temperature: 220°C and rising
Smoke: DETECTED
Suppression: ARMED - Manual release required
Bulkheads: SEALED (auto-isolation)
Atmosphere: Normal pressure, composition degrading
```

**Initial Information Available to Crew:**
- Fire location: Cargo Bay 2, forward-starboard section
- Cargo manifest indicates flammable magnesium present
- Auto-suppression system ready (CO₂ flood)
- Adjacent Bay 3 contains pressurized fuel (danger of chain reaction)

## Critical Decision Point #1 (T+0:00 to T+2:00)

**Immediate Actions Required:**

Crew must assess situation and choose fire suppression method:

### Option A: CO₂ Flood Suppression (Standard Response)
**Process:**
- Confirm crew clear of bay
- Activate CO₂ flood system
- Displaces oxygen, smothers most fires
- 60-second discharge cycle

**HAZARD - INCORRECT FOR THIS FIRE:**
- Magnesium burns even without oxygen
- Uses oxygen from CO₂ itself (chemical reaction: 2Mg + CO₂ → 2MgO + C)
- CO₂ flood will be INEFFECTIVE and waste suppression agent
- May actually intensify magnesium fire

**Outcome if chosen:**
- Fire continues burning despite CO₂
- Temperature continues rising: 220°C → 450°C → 800°C
- Crew wastes 2 minutes, must try different approach
- Some cargo damage
- Proceed to Decision Point #2 with reduced time

### Option B: Water Suppression (Common Misconception)
**Process:**
- Deploy hose from firefighting station
- Crew enters bay with protective gear
- Apply water to burning material

**HAZARD - DANGEROUS FOR METAL FIRES:**
- Magnesium reacts violently with water
- Reaction: Mg + 2H₂O → Mg(OH)₂ + H₂ (explosive hydrogen gas)
- Creates explosive atmosphere
- Intensifies fire dramatically
- Potential hydrogen explosion

**Outcome if chosen:**
- CRITICAL EVENT: Hydrogen explosion
- Fire spreads throughout bay
- Crew member injured (burns, blast trauma)
- Major damage to cargo bay
- Hull stress warnings
- Emergency situation escalates
- Proceed to emergency decompression (last resort)

### Option C: Dry Chemical Suppression (Correct for Metal Fires)
**Process:**
- Identify fire as Class D (metal fire)
- Deploy dry chemical extinguisher (copper powder or sodium chloride)
- Crew enters bay with protective gear and extinguisher
- Apply dry chemical to smother reaction

**Outcome if chosen:**
- Chemical powder smothers magnesium
- Temperature stabilizes then decreases
- Fire contained in 8-12 minutes
- Minimal cargo damage
- Best outcome - proceed to recovery operations

### Option D: Bay Decompression (Nuclear Option)
**Process:**
- Evacuate all adjacent bays
- Open cargo bay outer door to space
- Rapid decompression extinguishes fire by removing heat and any atmospheric component

**Outcome if chosen:**
- Effective for extinguishing fire
- All cargo in Bay 2 lost to space (ejected or destroyed)
- Risk of damage to bay door mechanism
- Possible hull stress from rapid pressure change
- 30 minutes to re-pressurize and inspect
- Expensive solution (lose 4 tons of cargo worth 85,000 credits)
- Proceed to damage assessment

## Scenario Branch: Option A Selected (CO₂ Flood - Incorrect)

**T+2:00**: CO₂ discharge complete
**Result**: Fire continues burning, temperature now 450°C

**Cargo Specialist report:** "Captain, fire is still burning! Magnesium doesn't need oxygen - it's breaking down the CO₂!"

**Engineer:** "Temperature rising fast. We've got maybe 10 minutes before it gets hot enough to damage the hull plating."

### Decision Point #2A: Recognition and Correction

**Option A1**: Deploy dry chemical (correct response, but delayed)
- Crew now understands metal fire requirements
- Time lost, but can still save situation
- Some cargo damaged by prolonged heat
- 15 minutes to suppress fire
- Minor hull stress, no structural damage

**Option A2**: Emergency decompression
- Fast solution to prevent hull damage
- Lose all Bay 2 cargo
- Clean up and re-pressurize needed
- Safe but expensive

**Option A3**: Continue with water (critical error)
- If crew doesn't understand metal fires, may try water next
- Leads to explosion outcome (see Option B below)

## Scenario Branch: Option B Selected (Water - Critical Error)

**T+3:00**: Crew member enters bay with water hose
**T+3:30**: Water contacts burning magnesium

**CRITICAL EVENT: Violent Chemical Reaction**

```
WARNING - EXPLOSION DETECTED
Cargo Bay 2: Overpressure event
Crew member status: INJURED
Fire: SPREADING
Hull Integrity: 94% (stress warning)
Emergency bulkheads: HOLDING
```

**Damage Report:**
- Fire spread to adjacent cargo drums
- Hydrogen explosion damaged cargo bay interior
- 1 crew member injured: 2nd degree burns, blast trauma
- Hull plating stressed but holding
- Bay 2 now fully involved in fire
- Temperature: 850°C and climbing
- Bay 3 bulkhead heating up (deuterium tanks at risk)

### Decision Point #2B: Emergency Response

**Immediate situation:**
- Injured crew member needs medical attention
- Fire out of control
- Secondary hazard: Bay 3 deuterium tanks heating up
- Hull at risk if fire not stopped in 5 minutes

**Option B1**: Emergency decompression (only safe option remaining)
- Evacuate injured crew member
- Decompress Bay 2 immediately
- Lose all cargo but save ship
- Treat injured crew member
- 2-3 hour recovery and damage assessment

**Option B2**: Attempt dry chemical with remaining crew (risky)
- Fire now too large for portable extinguishers
- Crew at risk from heat and damaged bay
- May not be effective at this stage
- If fails, forced to decompress anyway with more hull damage

**Option B3**: Do nothing / hesitate (catastrophic)
- Hull breach within 8 minutes
- Bay 3 deuterium tanks rupture
- Secondary fire
- Possible ship loss
- Training scenario FAILED

## Scenario Branch: Option C Selected (Dry Chemical - Correct)

**T+2:00**: Cargo Specialist and Engineer suit up
**T+4:00**: Enter Cargo Bay 2 with dry chemical extinguishers (copper powder type)

**Fire Suppression Process:**

**T+4:00 to T+8:00**: Initial application
- Approach burning drums from upwind (if using bay ventilation)
- Apply copper powder from 2 meters distance
- Work to cover all burning surfaces
- Powder smothers magnesium, cuts off reaction

**Progress Report T+8:00:**
```
Bay 2 Status: Fire 70% suppressed
Temperature: 380°C (decreasing)
Smoke: Heavy but clearing via ventilation
Crew: Uninjured, supplies adequate
```

**T+8:00 to T+12:00**: Complete suppression
- Continue applying dry chemical
- Check for hot spots
- Verify no smoldering remains
- Temperature drops below 200°C

**T+12:00**: Fire fully suppressed
```
Bay 2 Status: Fire EXTINGUISHED
Temperature: 165°C (safe, cooling)
Damage: 3 of 20 drums involved, cargo loss minimal
Hull: No damage, normal stress readings
Crew: Uninjured, effective response
```

**Outcome**: SUCCESSFUL - Minimal damage, crew safe, ship undamaged

## Post-Fire Operations (After Successful Suppression)

### Immediate Actions (T+12:00 to T+30:00)

1. **Atmosphere Safety Check**
   - Test bay atmosphere for toxic gases
   - Magnesium oxide dust present (irritant but not toxic)
   - Ventilate bay for 30 minutes before removing protective gear
   - Deploy portable air scrubber if available

2. **Hot Spot Inspection**
   - Use thermal camera to scan entire bay
   - Check for smoldering material in adjacent cargo
   - Verify temperature decreasing steadily
   - Monitor for 2 hours to confirm no re-ignition

3. **Cargo Assessment**
   - 3 drums (600kg) magnesium destroyed/contaminated: Loss of 12,000 credits
   - 17 drums (3,400kg) intact and salvageable: Retained value 68,000 credits
   - Adjacent cargo (Bays 1, 3, 4): Undamaged
   - Total loss: 15% of Bay 2 cargo

4. **Damage Inspection**
   - Hull plating: No damage (max temperature below design limits)
   - Bay interior: Soot and chemical residue (cleaning required)
   - Fire suppression system: CO₂ system unused, dry chemical exhausted
   - Bulkhead seals: Tested and confirmed intact

### Investigation (T+30:00 to T+60:00)

**Root Cause Analysis:**

Crew must investigate fire origin:

**Evidence to examine:**
1. Burn pattern on damaged drums (where fire started)
2. Cargo loading records (how drums positioned)
3. Bay environmental logs (temperature, humidity before fire)
4. Drum condition (damage, corrosion, seals)
5. Electrical system in bay (potential ignition source)

**Discovered Root Cause:**
- Cargo improperly secured during loading at origin port
- Ship maneuvering caused drums to shift
- Two drums collided, one punctured
- Magnesium powder spilled onto bay deck
- Powder contacted electrical junction box with exposed wiring
- Spark from electrical short ignited magnesium dust
- Fire spread to intact drums

**Contributing Factors:**
1. **Cargo Specialist Error**: Did not verify proper tie-down at loading
2. **Shipper Error**: Inadequate packaging for Class 4.1 material (drums should be in secondary containment)
3. **Maintenance Oversight**: Electrical junction box cover was loose/missing (should have been caught in weekly inspection)

### Corrective Actions

**Immediate:**
- Inspect all remaining magnesium drums for damage
- Re-secure all cargo with proper tie-downs and spacing
- Repair/cover electrical junction box
- Document incident for port authority and insurance

**Prevent Recurrence:**
- Institute mandatory cargo inspection before accepting shipment
- Require secondary containment for all powdered Class 4.1 materials
- Add electrical junction box covers to weekly inspection checklist
- Additional training on hazmat cargo procedures
- Update cargo manifest to flag incompatible materials

### Reporting and Compliance

**Required Reports:**
1. **Port Authority** (destination station): Incident report within 24 hours
2. **Outer Rim Starship Manufacturing**: Safety incident per warranty terms
3. **Insurance Company**: Cargo loss claim (12,000 credits)
4. **Shipper/Cargo Owner**: Notice of damaged cargo, preliminary cause
5. **Safety Board**: Formal incident report within 7 days

**Legal/Financial Implications:**
- Investigation may assign liability for cargo loss
- Shipper liable if packaging inadequate
- Ship owner liable if maintenance/cargo handling negligent
- Likely split liability (inadequate packaging + loose electrical cover)

## Scenario Branch: Option D Selected (Decompression)

**T+2:00**: Decision made to decompress bay
**T+2:00 to T+4:00**: Preparation
- Verify Bays 1, 3, 4 sealed and crew clear
- Open inner bulkhead warning: "DECOMPRESSION IMMINENT"
- Crew at safe stations

**T+4:00**: Open cargo bay outer door

**Decompression Event:**
```
Bay 2 pressure: 101 kPa → 0 kPa in 45 seconds
Fire: EXTINGUISHED (heat and atmosphere removed)
Cargo: Loose items ejected to space
Temperature: Drops rapidly to -200°C (space environment)
```

**Outcome:**
- Fire successfully extinguished
- All 20 drums of magnesium lost (ejected or destroyed): 85,000 credit loss
- Bay undamaged structurally
- No crew injuries
- Safe but very expensive solution

**Recovery (T+4:00 to T+90:00):**
1. Close outer door
2. Inspect bay door seals and mechanism
3. Re-pressurize bay slowly (30 minutes)
4. Inspect for damage
5. Clean bay of debris
6. Return to service

**Post-Event:**
- File insurance claim for total cargo loss
- Investigation still required (root cause)
- Corrective actions still needed

   - CO₂ ineffective, water dangerous
   - Dry chemical (copper, sodium chloride) or smothering agents only

2. **Know Your Cargo**
   - Review manifest before accepting cargo
   - Understand hazards of materials aboard
   - Plan for worst-case scenarios

3. **Decision Making Under Pressure**
   - Take 30 seconds to assess before acting
   - Wrong suppression method can worsen situation
   - When unsure, consult emergency guides or hazmat data

4. **Secondary Hazards**
   - Fire in Bay 2 threatened Bay 3 (deuterium)
   - Cascading failures possible
   - Isolate and monitor adjacent hazards

5. **Decompression as Last Resort**
   - Effective but expensive
   - Use when other methods failed or insufficient time
   - Better to lose cargo than ship or crew
