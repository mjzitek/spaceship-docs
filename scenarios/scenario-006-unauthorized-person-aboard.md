## Scenario Introduction

**DAY 3 OF TRANSIT - 14:30 HOURS**

**Setting:** You are the Captain. Your engineer, Torres, calls you on the comm.

**Torres (via comm):** "Captain, we have a situation in Cargo Bay 2. You need to see this. Bring backup."

**His tone is serious but not panicked.**

When you arrive with your pilot (Chen), you find Torres standing near a cargo container marked "CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT - NEW BRISBANE MINING CO." The container door is slightly ajar.

**Torres:** "I was doing routine cargo checks when I heard something inside this container. Thought maybe something came loose. Then I heard... well, I heard someone coughing."

**You open the container door fully.**

Inside, you find:
- A young woman, approximately 20-25 years old
- She looks frightened, dehydrated, and exhausted
- Surrounded by food wrappers and water bottles (some empty, some from your cargo)
- A small backpack with personal belongings
- No weapons visible

**The woman:** "Please... please don't turn back. I'll work. I'll pay. Just don't take me back to Theta Station."

## Initial Decisions

**Decision Point 1: Immediate Response**

The crew looks to you for direction. Choose your approach:

**OPTION A: Aggressive Security Posture**
- Treat as security threat until proven otherwise
- Restrain and isolate immediately
- Full security lockdown
- Minimize interaction

**OPTION B: Cautious But Humane**
- Secure but don't restrain unless necessary
- Move to secure location (not brig, but isolated quarters)
- Medical check
- Interview to assess situation

**OPTION C: Minimal Intervention**
- Leave in container but provide basic needs
- Periodic checks
- Delay decision-making
- Minimize crew involvement

**OPTION D: Immediate Return Decision**
- Announce intention to turn back immediately
- Company policy is clear
- Let her know she'll face legal consequences
- No room for debate

---

### Outcome: Option B Selected (Recommended Path)

**You (Captain):** "Alright. Miss, I'm Captain Rivera. You're aboard the *Vagrant's Hope* unauthorized. Right now, I need you to come with me calmly. We're not going to hurt you, but we need to secure you and figure out what's happening. Do you understand?"

**Woman:** *nods, crying* "Yes. Thank you. Thank you."

**You (to Torres):** "Help her up, gently. Chen, prep the auxiliary crew quarter. Torres, after you get her settled, I want a full cargo inventory - see what else might be missing or disturbed."

**You (to woman):** "What's your name?"

**Woman:** "Kira. Kira Matheson."

## Investigation Phase

**AUXILIARY CREW QUARTER - 15:00 HOURS**

Your crew member with medical training (Chen) performs a basic check:
- Moderately dehydrated
- Minor malnutrition (hasn't eaten well for 3+ days)
- Bruising on arms (not fresh, at least 1-2 weeks old)
- Exhausted but stable
- No signs of drug use
- No communicable diseases obvious

**Chen provides water and a basic meal.**

**You interview Kira:**

**Kira's Story:**
"I was working on Theta Station, in the entertainment district. I got into debt with the wrong people - loan sharks, basically. They said I owed 45,000 credits. I was working it off but they kept adding 'interest' and 'fees.' Then they said I'd work for them permanently or... or they'd sell my contract to a mining operation.

"I heard New Brisbane Colony is hiring, good wages, worker protections. I thought if I could get there, I could start over. Pay off the debt legitimately. But I couldn't afford passage. No one would hire me with my debt flagged in the system.

"I watched your cargo loading. I saw an opportunity. I'm sorry. I know it's wrong. I know you could get in trouble. But I was desperate. They were going to... I couldn't stay there."

**She shows you the bruising on her arms.**

"This is what happens when you miss a payment."

**Investigation Results:**

Your cargo handler (Torres) reports:
- 3 water bottles missing from medical supplies cargo (value: ~15 credits)
- 6 ration bars missing from crew reserves (value: ~30 credits)
- No other damage or theft
- Container was properly sealed from Theta Station (she was inside before loading)

**Background Check (if you have comm access to databases):**
- Kira Matheson: Registered worker on Theta Station
- No criminal record
- Debt flagged: 45,000 credits to "Theta Entertainment Services LLC"
- Employment contract under dispute
- No outstanding warrants, but debt collectors have legal claim

## Decision Point 2: Major Decision Required

**You must decide Kira's fate. Options:**

### OPTION A: Return to Theta Station (By the Book)
**Pros:**
- Follows company policy exactly
- No legal risk to you or crew
- No liability if she's dangerous or lying
- Company won't penalize you

**Cons:**
- 6 days lost (3 days back, 3 days to current position again)
- Delays medical supply delivery to colony
- Kira faces criminal charges + returned to debt collectors
- Humanitarian concerns - her story may be true
- Fuel costs, time costs

**Resource Impact:**
- Additional fuel cost: ~12,000 credits
- Time delay: Medical supplies delayed 6 days
- Your delivery bonus: Forfeited (~5,000 credits)

### OPTION B: Continue to New Brisbane, Turn Her Over to Authorities
**Pros:**
- Maintains schedule
- Lets colonial authorities handle it
- They have better resources to verify her story
- You're not deciding her fate alone

**Cons:**
- Still violates company policy (should return within 48 hours)
- Company may impose penalties (~10,000 credits)
- You're still liable for any issues en route
- She may still be returned to Theta Station by authorities

**Resource Impact:**
- Company fine (likely): ~10,000 credits
- Report in your record
- Possible sanctions for future cargo contracts

### OPTION C: Continue to New Brisbane, Help Her Disappear
**Pros:**
- Humanitarian - gives her the fresh start she needs
- No delay to schedule
- Minimal life support impact (see below)
- She works to earn passage

**Cons:**
- Directly violates company policy
- If discovered, heavy fines, possible license suspension
- Legal risk if she's lying or dangerous
- Sets precedent (word might spread)
- Ethical questions about circumventing law

**Resource Impact:**
- If discovered: 25,000-100,000 credit fine + possible criminal charges
- Life support (11 days extra person): Minimal impact on your ship size
- She has no money to actually pay passage

### OPTION D: Offer Limited Assistance Compromise
**Pros:**
- Middle ground approach
- Help her within legal bounds
- Connect her with refugee/worker advocacy
- Report stowaway but advocate for leniency

**Cons:**
- Still must return or face penalties
- Outcome still uncertain for her
- Time/fuel costs similar to Option A

**Resource Impact:**
- Similar to Option A or B depending on execution
- Your advocacy may or may not help her case

## Life Support Considerations

**Torres (Engineer) reports:**

"Captain, I've run the numbers. Adding one person for 11 days:

**Life Support Impact:**
- O₂ consumption increase: ~6% (well within reserves)
- Water: 35 liters needed (we have 2,000L reserve)
- Food: 11 days rations (we have 90-day supply for crew)
- CO₂ scrubbing: Minimal impact, system rated for 8 people, we're running 4
- Power: Negligible increase

**Bottom line:** Life support is NOT an issue. We could carry 2-3 extra people easily for this duration."

**So, resource-wise, she's not a problem. The problem is policy and law.**

## Crew Input

**Your crew weighs in (optional - you can hear them out or decide alone):**

**Torres (Engineer):** "Captain, I've got a sister. She got into a bad situation once, different circumstances but... look, if someone hadn't helped her, she wouldn't be here today. I'm not saying break the law, but... Kira's story sounds real to me. Those bruises aren't fake."

**Chen (Pilot):** "Company policy exists for a reason, Captain. We don't know her. She could be lying. She could be dangerous. We could get impounded at New Brisbane if they scan for unexpected bio-signs. I'm not heartless, but we have responsibilities. To the company, to each other, to our cargo contracts."

**Your cargo handler:** "I say we take a vote. But honestly, Captain, this is your call. We'll back whatever you decide. But yeah, you're on the hook if it goes wrong."

## Scenario Branches

### If You Choose to Help Her (Option C):

**Your Plan:**
1. Keep Kira hidden for the 11-day transit
2. She works basic labor - cleaning, meal prep, cargo organization
3. On arrival, you offload cargo at multiple locations (normal for your route)
4. At one of the outlying landing zones (New Brisbane Mining Outpost #4), she "disappears" into the colony
5. You report "stowaway discovered, escaped custody during unloading" (plausible)
6. She gets her fresh start

**Complications That Arise:**

**Day 6:**
During a meal, Kira mentions her debt collectors have tracking connections with some freight companies. "They pay for tips on people who run. If your company reports I was here, they'll know where to look."

**Day 8:**
Unexpected communication from New Brisbane Port Authority: "*Vagrant's Hope*, be advised we're conducting random bio-scans on incoming vessels due to recent smuggling concerns. Declare all persons aboard for health screening."

**You must decide:**
- Risk the bio-scan (they'll detect 5 people, you declared 4)
- Admit stowaway now (before arrival)
- Find a way to hide her during scan (possible but risky)
- Abort and divert to alternate landing site (costs time/fuel, raises suspicions)

**Day 10:**
Kira overhears your plan to report her as "escaped." She's upset: "If you report me at all, it goes in the system. They'll find me. Please, just... say I was never here. Say you never found me."

**Final Decision Point:**
Commit fully to helping her (falsify records, high risk) or turn her in after all?

### If You Choose to Return (Option A):

**Day 4 (returning to Theta Station):**

Kira is distraught. "Please. Please don't do this. You don't understand. They'll kill me. Maybe not literally but... please."

She's not eating. Chen reports she's showing signs of severe anxiety and depression.

**Decision:**
- Continue return?
- Change your mind? (can still alter course)
- Keep her sedated for her own safety? (ethical issues)

**Day 6 (arriving Theta Station):**

You contact station authorities to report stowaway. They acknowledge and prepare to take custody.

But then: Torres pulls you aside. "Captain, I did some digging. Theta Entertainment Services LLC? They're a known front for traffickers. Her debt was probably manufactured. We turn her over, we're sending her into slavery, not justice."

**Decision:**
- Turn her over to authorities anyway (policy)
- Refuse to hand her over, leave station, now YOU'RE in legal trouble
- Demand authorities investigate the debt company first

### If You Choose Colonial Authorities (Option B):

**Day 14 (arrival at New Brisbane):**

You report the stowaway to Port Authority. They take custody of Kira.

**Three Outcomes Possible (random or instructor choice):**

**Outcome 1 (Best):** Colonial authorities investigate, determine her debt was illegitimate, grant her refugee status. She thanks you for giving her the chance.

**Outcome 2 (Middle):** Authorities hold her for 30 days while investigating. Outcome unclear. You never find out what happened to her.

**Outcome 3 (Worst):** Colony has extradition agreement with Theta Station. She's returned within 48 hours. You see her being loaded onto a transport ship, escorted by two rough-looking men. She sees you, doesn't say anything, just looks at you. Torres is furious with you.

## Scenario Debrief Questions

**For Discussion:**

1. **Legal vs. Ethical:** When do we break rules for the right reasons? Where's the line?

2. **Risk Assessment:** How much risk (financial, legal, personal) are we willing to take for a stranger?

3. **Verification:** How do we verify someone's story? Kira could be lying. How do we know?

4. **Crew Dynamics:** If your crew disagrees with your decision, how do you maintain authority and morale?

5. **Precedent:** If you help Kira, what happens next time? What if someone dangerous uses the same story?

6. **Company vs. Conscience:** You work for a company. You follow rules. But you're also human. How do you balance these?

7. **Practical Concerns:** Even if you want to help, what if you can't afford the fines? What if you lose your license and can't feed your own family?

## Real-World Parallels

This scenario reflects real challenges in:
- Maritime law (stowaways on ships)
- Immigration and asylum
- Human trafficking
- Debt bondage
- Whistleblower decisions (report illegal activity vs. follow orders)

## Instructor Notes

**No Single "Right" Answer:**
This scenario is designed to be ambiguous. Different choices have different consequences, all with valid reasoning.

**Key Learning:**
- Decision-making under uncertainty
- Balancing competing priorities
- Leadership in ethical dilemmas
- Risk assessment
- Consequences of actions (intended and unintended)

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Does the participant consider multiple perspectives?
- Do they think through consequences?
- Do they balance empathy with pragmatism?
- How do they handle crew disagreement?
- Do they adapt when new information emerges?

**Variations:**
- Change Kira's story (make her actually dangerous, or a spy, or running from false accusations)
- Change company policy (more lenient, more harsh)
- Add a "ticking clock" (ship emergency, forcing faster decision)
- Add media attention (reporters get wind of stowaway)

## Recommended Follow-Up Training

- **Legal training:** Space law regarding stowaways, passengers, crew
- **Ethics seminar:** Ethical decision-making frameworks
- **Security training:** Proper search and secure procedures
- **Company policy review:** Understanding policy intent and flexibility

**This scenario has no easy answers. That's the point. Command means making hard choices with incomplete information.**

**How you decide matters. How you treat people matters. How you live with your decisions matters.**

**Discuss. Learn. Grow.**
