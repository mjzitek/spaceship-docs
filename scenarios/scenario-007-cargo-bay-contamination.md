## Initial Contact

### Customer Opening Statement

**Vessel:** Independent freighter "Dawn Hauler"
**Location:** Deep space, 2 days from nearest port
**Crew:** 4 (Captain, Pilot, 2 Cargo Handlers)
**Cargo:** Mixed commercial freight (200 containers)
**Current Status:** Cargo bay alarm triggered

**Customer (Cargo Handler, coughing):**

> "*cough cough* Support, we've got a serious problem in cargo bay 2. Some kind of chemical leak - there's yellowish vapor everywhere and it burns to breathe. My partner collapsed. I had to drag him out. The cargo alarm is screaming and I can see liquid pooling under container C-247. What is this stuff and what do we do?!"

### Initial Information Display

**Cargo Bay Status:**
- Atmospheric alarm: ACTIVE (Contamination Detected)
- Bay 2 atmosphere: HAZARD (toxic vapors detected)
- Chemical sensor: POSITIVE for organic vapors (unknown specific compound)
- Temperature: 24°C (normal)
- Pressure: 14.5 PSI (normal)
- Automated systems: Sealing bay 2, activating emergency ventilation

**Crew Status:**
- Cargo Handler 1 (caller): Conscious, respiratory distress, eyes burning
- Cargo Handler 2: Unconscious, dragged from cargo bay, unknown exposure duration

**Visual Report:**
- Yellowish vapor cloud in cargo bay 2, approximately 2 meters diameter
- Liquid pooling beneath container C-247 (approximately 10-15 liters)
- Strong chemical odor (similar to solvents)
- Container C-247 appears damaged (dent in side, seam split)

## Phase 1: Immediate Crew Safety (3-5 minutes)

### Key Questions to Ask

**Agent must prioritize life safety first:**

1. **"Are you and your partner out of the cargo bay now? Is the bay sealed?"**
   - **Answer**: "Yes, we're in the corridor. The automatic doors sealed behind us. He's lying here unconscious."
   - **Purpose**: Confirm crew clear of immediate hazard

2. **"Is your unconscious partner breathing? Check for chest movement and breath sounds."**
   - **Answer**: "Yes, he's breathing. It's kind of wheezy but he's breathing. Should I do CPR?"
   - **Purpose**: Assess medical urgency

3. **"How long was your partner in the vapor before you got him out?"**
   - **Answer**: "Maybe 2-3 minutes. He went in to check the alarm, then I heard him yelling then he went quiet. I held my breath and dragged him out."
   - **Purpose**: Estimate exposure severity

4. **"Are you experiencing any symptoms yourself? Breathing difficulty, dizziness, nausea?"**
   - **Answer**: "*cough* My throat burns and my eyes are watering badly. I feel dizzy and kind of sick to my stomach."
   - **Purpose**: Assess caller's exposure and ability to continue helping

5. **"I need the cargo container number and shipping code. You said C-247. Is there a hazmat placard or shipping code on that container?"**
   - **Answer**: "Let me check the manifest... Container C-247, shipping code UN-1263, labeled 'Flammable Liquid, Paint Products, 3.'"
   - **Purpose**: Identify specific chemical hazard

### Expected Agent Response

**Agent must act decisively for medical emergency:**

1. **Medical priority**:
   > "Listen carefully. Your partner is unconscious from chemical exposure but still breathing - that's good. We need to get him away from the cargo bay, give him fresh air, and monitor him. Can you and another crew member move him to a well-ventilated area, at least 20 meters from the cargo bay?"

2. **Identify hazard**:
   > "UN-1263 is paint-related solvents - mixture of organic chemicals. The vapors are toxic and flammable. This is serious but manageable if we act quickly."

3. **Caller safety**:
   > "You've also been exposed. Your symptoms - burning throat, eye irritation, dizziness - are consistent with solvent vapor inhalation. You need fresh air and rest. I need you to get someone else to help you, do not try to handle this alone while you're symptomatic."

4. **Immediate actions**:
   > "Here's what needs to happen in the next 5 minutes: 1) Move your partner to ship's medical bay or fresh air area, 2) You need to rest and recover from your exposure, 3) Get your captain or another crew member on this call to handle the cargo bay, 4) Do NOT let anyone enter cargo bay 2 until we assess the situation. Understood?"

## Phase 2: Medical Response (5-10 minutes)

### Unconscious Crew Member Treatment

**Captain now on the call, crew member has been moved to medical bay:**

**Agent provides medical guidance:**

> "Captain, your crew member is suffering from acute solvent vapor inhalation. He's unconscious but breathing, which means he got a heavy dose but his airway is open. Here's what you need to do immediately..."

### Medical Treatment Steps

**Step 1: Fresh Air and Positioning**
- Place in recovery position (on side, head tilted back)
- Ensure airway is clear
- Provide fresh air (open ventilation to maximum in medical bay)
- Remove any contaminated clothing (solvent may have soaked clothing)

**Step 2: Monitor Vitals**
- Check breathing every 60 seconds (should be regular)
- Check pulse (should be steady)
- Monitor skin color (bluish tint means insufficient oxygen)

**Step 3: Oxygen Support**
- If available, provide supplemental oxygen via mask
- Set to 4-6 liters per minute

**Step 4: Watch for Changes**
- **If breathing stops**: Begin CPR immediately
- **If vomits**: Turn to side, clear airway
- **If convulses**: Protect from injury, do not restrain

**Agent:**
> "He should regain consciousness within 10-30 minutes as the fresh air clears the chemicals from his system. When he wakes, he may be confused or nauseous - this is normal. Keep him lying down and resting. Do NOT let him go back to work today."

### Exposed Crew Member Treatment

**For the cargo handler who dragged partner out:**

**Agent:**
> "The handler who rescued his partner also has symptoms. He needs to rest in fresh air for at least 2 hours. Monitor for worsening symptoms - severe headache, confusion, difficulty breathing. If symptoms worsen, treat same as the unconscious crew member."

**Expected Timeline:**
- Mild symptoms should improve in 30-60 minutes
- Full recovery 4-8 hours
- Possible lingering throat irritation for 24 hours

## Phase 3: Cargo Bay Assessment (5-10 minutes)

### Chemical Identification

**Agent should explain hazard:**

> "Captain, UN-1263 paint solvents are typically a mixture of acetone, toluene, xylene, and other organic solvents. The hazards are:"

**Hazards:**
1. **Toxic vapor** - Causes respiratory irritation, dizziness, unconsciousness at high concentration
2. **Flammable** - Vapor can ignite from spark, flame, or hot surface
3. **Explosive** - Vapor/air mixture can explode if ignited in confined space
4. **Skin/eye irritant** - Direct contact burns

**Immediate Dangers:**
- Vapor concentration may be building up in cargo bay
- If reaches 1-13% concentration in air (flammable range), single spark can cause explosion
- Continued leak increases contamination and vapor concentration

### Cargo Bay Status Check

**Agent:**
> "Your automated system sealed the bay and activated emergency ventilation - that's exactly right. Let me check what your current bay status shows..."

**Captain reads displays:**
- Bay 2 sealed: Confirmed
- Emergency ventilation: Active (venting to space, replacing with filtered air)
- Vapor sensor: Still detecting organic vapors (concentration decreasing slowly)
- Temperature: 24°C (stable - no fire)
- Electrical systems in bay: Automatically powered down (prevents ignition)

**Agent:**
> "Good. The system is doing what it should. Ventilation is clearing the vapor but it takes time. The automatic electrical shutdown prevents ignition risk. Do NOT open the bay or re-energize electrical until vapor concentration is zero."

### Leak Assessment

**Agent:**
> "Based on your description, container C-247 has a split seam and is leaking. Approximately how large is the damaged area? Can you see it on the external cameras?"

**Captain (checking cameras):**
> "The cargo bay cameras show... looks like a 15-20 cm split along the bottom seam. Liquid is dripping slowly but steadily. The pool underneath is spreading."

**Agent:**
> "Okay. Paint solvent containers typically hold 200-400 liters. If the split is along the bottom, the leak will continue until either: 1) The liquid level drops below the split, or 2) The container is repaired or sealed. At current leak rate, this could continue for hours."

## Phase 4: Leak Containment Decision (10-15 minutes)

### Options Presentation

**Agent must present options clearly:**

**Option 1: Allow Leak to Continue While Venting**
- **Pro**: No crew enters hazardous area (safest for crew)
- **Pro**: Ventilation will eventually clear vapor
- **Con**: Solvent will continue leaking (cargo loss, contamination)
- **Con**: Takes 4-6 hours to fully clear vapor
- **Con**: Cargo bay contaminated with solvent residue
- **Timeline**: 4-6 hours until bay safe to enter

**Option 2: Emergency Containment**
- **Pro**: Stops leak quickly, minimizes cargo loss
- **Pro**: Reduces contamination spread
- **Con**: Requires crew entry to hazardous area (risk)
- **Con**: Crew needs protective equipment
- **Timeline**: 30-60 minutes if successful

**Option 3: Seal and Depressurize Bay**
- **Pro**: Venting to vacuum eliminates vapor instantly
- **Pro**: Completely safe (no fire/explosion risk)
- **Con**: Leaked solvent will freeze then boil off to space (messy)
- **Con**: Any unsealed cargo in bay may be damaged
- **Con**: Must re-pressurize bay later (uses atmospheric reserves)
- **Timeline**: 15 minutes to vent, 30 minutes to re-pressurize

**Agent should ask:**
> "Captain, this is your decision. What's your priority - crew safety, cargo preservation, or time? Also, do you have protective equipment aboard - respirators or atmosphere suits?"

### Customer Decision

**Captain:**
> "Crew safety first, but we have atmosphere suits with 1-hour air supply. If we can safely seal that container, I'd rather not lose the whole cargo. Plus the customer who owns that container would appreciate us trying to save it."

**Agent:**
> "Understood. If you're going to attempt containment, here's how we do it safely..."

## Phase 5: Containment Procedure (10-15 minutes)

### Pre-Entry Preparation

**Agent provides detailed procedure:**

1. **Verify ventilation has reduced vapor:**
   - Wait until vapor sensor shows <50% of previous reading
   - Currently at 100%, need to wait 15-20 minutes
   - Continue emergency ventilation

2. **Prepare containment materials:**
   - Emergency patch kit or leak sealant
   - Absorbent pads for spilled liquid
   - Secondary containment (tarp, pan, or barrier)
   - Disposal bags for contaminated materials

3. **Prepare crew for entry:**
   - Full atmosphere suit with self-contained air supply
   - Two crew minimum (one to seal leak, one as safety backup outside bay)
   - Communication check (radio between crew members and bridge)
   - 30-minute time limit (sufficient safety margin on 1-hour air supply)

**Agent:**
> "Do not enter until vapor concentration has dropped below 50% of current level and is still decreasing. This typically takes 20-30 minutes with active ventilation."

### 20 Minutes Later: Vapor Concentration Reduced

**Captain:**
> "Vapor sensor now showing 40% of original concentration and still dropping. Crew is suited up and ready."

**Agent:**
> "Good. Vapor is now below explosive concentration but still irritant. The suits will protect them. Here's the step-by-step procedure..."

### Entry and Containment Procedure

**Step 1: Entry**
- Two crew in full suits enter cargo bay
- One crew remains outside bay as safety monitor
- Keep bay door open (do not seal crew inside)
- Maintain radio communication

**Step 2: Approach Leak**
- Approach container C-247 carefully (deck may be slippery from solvent)
- Avoid walking through liquid (contaminates suit)
- Assess damage close-up (verify location and size of split)

**Step 3: Apply Seal**
- Clean area around split (wipe with cloth)
- Apply emergency sealant or patch over split
- Hold pressure for 60 seconds (sealant sets)
- Check seal (should stop or greatly reduce dripping)

**Step 4: Secondary Containment**
- Place absorbent pads around container to soak up residual leaks
- If available, place container in secondary containment (tarp underneath)
- Mark container as damaged (do not stack anything on it)

**Step 5: Exit**
- Exit cargo bay
- Close bay door
- Remove suits in decontamination area
- Wash suited crew (solvent may have contacted suits)

**Actual Execution:**

**Crew member (from inside bay):**
> "I can see the split. It's a 20 cm crack along the bottom seam. The drip has slowed - level must be dropping. Applying sealant... pressing... okay, it's holding. Leak stopped!"

**Captain:**
> "Great! Place the absorbent pads and get out of there."

**2 minutes later:**

**Captain:**
> "They're out. Leak is sealed. Vapor concentration is still dropping."

**Agent:**
> "Excellent work. Keep ventilation running for another 1-2 hours until vapor concentration reaches zero. Do not re-energize bay electrical until then."

## Phase 6: Cleanup and Follow-Up (5-10 minutes)

### Decontamination

**Agent guides cleanup:**

1. **Crew decontamination:**
   - Suits to be washed down with water
   - Crew showers recommended (may have skin contact)
   - Contaminated clothing sealed in bags for proper disposal

2. **Cargo bay decontamination:**
   - Once vapor cleared, enter with breathing protection
   - Absorb remaining pooled solvent with pads
   - Clean deck with water and detergent
   - Dispose of contaminated materials properly (cannot vent to space, regulations)

3. **Container handling:**
   - Container C-247 remains damaged (temporary seal only)
   - Offload at next port carefully (may re-leak)
   - Notify customer of damage

### Medical Follow-Up

**Agent:**
> "Check on your unconscious crew member. Has he regained consciousness yet?"

**Captain:**
> "Yes! He woke up about 10 minutes ago. Confused and has a bad headache, but he's conscious and talking."

**Agent:**
> "That's expected. He should rest for the remainder of today and tomorrow. If he experiences severe headache, vision changes, or difficulty breathing, contact medical emergency. The other handler who went in after him should also rest. Both should be fully recovered in 24 hours."

### Port Notification

**Agent:**
> "When you reach port in 2 days, you'll need to report this incident. Notify them of:"

- Hazmat leak (UN-1263, paint solvents)
- Container C-247 damaged (temporary seal, needs proper repair/offload)
- Crew exposure (2 crew, both recovered)
- Cargo bay cleaned but recommend inspection

**Agent:**
> "Port authorities may require hazmat inspection before you can offload. Have your incident log and cargo manifest ready."

## Post-Scenario Debrief

### Key Learning Points

1. **Immediate priorities in hazmat emergency:**
   - Crew safety first (evacuate, assess exposure, medical treatment)
   - Identify chemical (shipping code = hazard info)
   - Contain/control leak (prevent spread)
   - Prevent secondary hazards (fire, explosion)

2. **Chemical identification:**
   - Shipping codes (UN numbers) identify chemical and hazards
   - Cargo manifest provides chemical name and safety data
   - Symptoms help confirm chemical type (respiratory = vapors, etc.)

3. **Medical response to vapor inhalation:**
   - Fresh air is primary treatment
   - Recovery position for unconscious (prevents airway blockage)
   - Symptoms improve with time as chemical clears from system
   - Monitor for 24 hours (delayed symptoms possible)

4. **Leak containment decision:**
   - Balance crew safety vs. cargo preservation
   - Protective equipment allows safer containment
   - Ventilation reduces vapor hazard before entry
   - Time limits on hazardous area entry

5. **Flammable vapor precautions:**
   - Shut down electrical in contaminated areas
   - Ventilate before entry
   - Check vapor concentration (explosive range)
   - No ignition sources until vapor cleared

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Prioritizing cargo over crew**: Always evacuate and treat injured first
- **Entering without protection**: Toxic vapors cause rapid incapacitation
- **Ignoring fire/explosion risk**: Flammable vapors can explode
- **Not identifying chemical**: Cannot assess hazard without knowing chemical
- **Rushing containment**: Wait for ventilation to reduce vapor concentration

### Technical Details

**Why this scenario is challenging:**
- Multiple simultaneous concerns (medical, fire, toxic, cleanup)
- Time pressure (unconscious crew, continuing leak)
- Requires balancing crew safety with cargo protection
- Chemical hazards require specific knowledge
- Decision-making under stress

**Paint solvent vapor characteristics:**
- Heavier than air (pools in low areas)
- Flammable range: 1-13% concentration in air
- Toxic at concentrations above 200 ppm
- Causes unconsciousness at 1,000+ ppm
- Ventilation dilutes below hazardous levels in 30-60 minutes typically

## Scenario Variations

**Variation 1: Fire Ignition**
- Leak ignites before discovery
- Cargo bay fire along with toxic vapor
- Teaches fire + hazmat combined emergency
- May require fire suppression + ventilation

**Variation 2: Unknown Chemical**
- No shipping code or manifest
- Must identify from symptoms and characteristics
- Teaches detective work and precautionary approach
- More challenging risk assessment

**Variation 3: Crew Cannot Enter**
- Vapor concentration remains too high
- No protective equipment available
- Must choose venting or depressurization option
- Teaches alternatives when containment not possible

## Assessment Criteria

**Agent Performance Evaluation:**

**Excellent:**
- Immediately prioritized medical response (unconscious crew)
- Correctly identified chemical from UN code
- Assessed both medical and fire/explosion hazards
- Guided safe containment procedure with proper precautions
- Provided medical follow-up and port notification guidance
- Remained calm and methodical despite multiple urgent issues

**Good:**
- Managed safe outcome (crew recovered, leak contained)
- Identified major hazards
- Provided basic medical and containment guidance

**Needs Improvement:**
- Did not prioritize medical emergency
- Failed to identify chemical hazard
- Recommended entry without assessing vapor concentration
- Ignored fire/explosion risk
- Incomplete medical or cleanup guidance

---

**Instructor Notes**: This scenario teaches managing multiple simultaneous priorities - medical emergency, toxic hazard, fire risk, and cargo protection. Emphasize crew safety first, then methodical assessment and risk-managed containment. Agent must remain calm coordinator while customer handles stressful hands-on emergency.
