# TRAIN-RESCUE-001: Distressed Vessel Rescue Operation

**Training Module:** Emergency Response - Search and Rescue
**Difficulty:** Advanced
**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Prerequisites:** EVA Certification, Emergency Medical Training, Emergency Procedures
**Last Updated:** 2847.09.14

## Scenario Overview

**Situation**: Ship receives distress call from another vessel. Crew must locate, assess, and render assistance to distressed vessel. Tests crew's decision-making, rescue techniques, medical response, and resource management under time pressure.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Execute search and rescue procedures
- Assess distressed vessel safety before boarding
- Provide emergency medical care
- Make critical resource allocation decisions (help others vs. own ship safety)
- Coordinate with rescue authorities
- Document rescue for legal/insurance purposes

**Ship Configuration:**
- Model: Pathfinder-Class Scout (student ship)
- Crew: 3 (Captain, Pilot/Navigator, Engineer)
- Location: Outer Rim system, between stations (2 days from nearest help)
- Resources: Standard emergency supplies, limited medical equipment, 3-person ship

## Initial Conditions (T+0:00)

**Time**: 10:15 ship time
**Location**: In transit, 40 light-years from civilization
**Status**: Routine cargo run, all systems normal

**Distress Call Received:**

```
[Garbled transmission on 121.5 MHz emergency frequency]
"...ay...day...day! This is freighter Stellar... [static] ...life support failing...
[static] ...three crew aboard... oxygen down to... [static] ...12%... anyone receiving,
please respond... [static] ...coordinates 47.3-122.9... [static] ...losing power..."
[Transmission cuts out]
```

**Information Gleaned from Transmission:**
- Ship name: "Stellar [something]" (partial)
- Emergency: Life support failure
- Crew: 3 persons
- O₂ level: 12% (critical, <16% required for consciousness)
- Position: Approximate coordinates 47.3-122.9 (incomplete)
- Power issues: "Losing power"

**Current Student Ship Status:**
- Own O₂: Normal (21%)
- Own life support: Functional
- Fuel: 60% (adequate for detour)
- Emergency O₂ bottles aboard: 6 bottles (2 per crew, 6-8 hours each = 36-48 hrs total)
- Medical supplies: First aid kit (Level 2), no doctor aboard
- EVA suits: 3 suits, functional
- Cargo: Non-time-critical (can delay delivery)

## Critical Decision Point #1 (T+0:00 to T+5:00)

**Captain must decide: Respond to distress call or not?**

### Option A: Respond to Distress (Correct - Moral and Legal Obligation)

**Rationale:**
- Maritime law (space equivalent): Vessels must render assistance if able
- Moral obligation: Crew in immediate danger (12% O₂ = minutes to unconsciousness)
- No other ships likely in area (Outer Rim, sparse traffic)
- Student ship has resources to help (emergency O₂, EVA capability)

**Actions:**
1. Acknowledge distress (attempt to respond on 121.5 MHz)
2. Plot course to distressed vessel coordinates
3. Notify rescue authorities (121.5 MHz long-range, may not reach but try)
4. Prepare for rescue (crew briefing, equipment staging)

**Outcome:** Proceed to rescue scenario (continue below)

**Score Impact:** +10 points (correct decision)

---

### Option B: Do Not Respond (Incorrect - Violates Duty to Rescue)

**Possible reasons (all insufficient):**
- "Not our problem"
- "We have cargo to deliver" (cargo not time-critical, lives take priority)
- "We don't have resources" (false, ship has emergency supplies)
- "Too dangerous" (some risk, but manageable)

**Consequences:**
- Legal: Maritime law requires rendering assistance (failure may result in fines, license suspension)
- Moral: 3 people die who could have been saved
- Practical: Distressed crew's employer, insurance, families may pursue legal action

**Outcome:** Training scenario FAILED

**Score:** 0/100

---

**Captain decides: Option A (Respond)**

Captain announces: "All hands, we've received a distress call. Freighter with life support failure, crew in critical condition. We're the only ship in range. We're responding. Engineer, prepare emergency O₂ for transfer. Pilot, plot intercept course. I'll brief everyone on rescue procedures."

---

## Phase 1: Locate and Approach Distressed Vessel (T+5:00 to T+30:00)

### Task 1: Determine Exact Position (5-10 minutes)

**Challenge:** Coordinates incomplete (47.3-122.9 only, missing third coordinate)

**Navigator actions:**
1. **Assume third coordinate:**
   - If in plane of system (ecliptic): Z-coordinate near 0
   - Try scanning at Z=0, Z=+5, Z=-5 (most likely positions)

2. **Active scan:**
   - Use long-range sensors (IR, optical, radar)
   - Look for ship signature (heat, reflection, transponder)
   - Range: May need to get within 100,000 km to detect small freighter

3. **Communications attempts:**
   - Call on 121.5 MHz: "Freighter Stellar[unknown], this is Pathfinder, we received your distress call and are responding. Please acknowledge."
   - May not receive response (if power failed, radio may be down)

**Result after 10 minutes:**
- IR sensor detects faint heat signature at coordinates 47.3, -122.9, +3.2
- Distance: 150,000 km from student ship
- No response to radio calls (distressed ship not transmitting)

Navigator: "Captain, I have IR contact bearing 047, range 150,000 klicks. Looks like our distressed freighter. Not responding to radio. ETA 25 minutes at best speed."

Captain: "Pilot, intercept course. Engineer, how long can three people survive on 12% O₂?"

Engineer: "At 12%, they're probably already unconscious or near it. Maybe 10-15 minutes of useful consciousness, then they pass out. Hypoxia damage starts after that. We need to get O₂ to them within 30-45 minutes or they may have brain damage or worse."

---

### Task 2: Approach Distressed Vessel (15-20 minutes)

**Pilot maneuvers:**
- Accelerate toward target (max safe acceleration)
- Close range to 150,000 km → 10,000 km → 1,000 km → 100 m
- Match velocity with distressed vessel (should be drifting, minimal velocity)

**At 10 km, visual contact:**

**Description of distressed freighter:**
- Model: Frontier-Class Medium Freighter (older, 20+ years)
- Condition: Exterior lights OFF (no power), drifting (no propulsion)
- Visible damage: Scorch marks near reactor compartment (possible electrical fire or reactor issue)
- No exterior movement or signs of life
- Estimated crew capacity: 3-6 persons (matches distress call of 3 crew)

**Captain assessment:**
- Ship appears dead in space (no power, no lights, no communications)
- Crew inside likely unconscious from hypoxia by now (25 minutes since distress call)
- Need immediate boarding and O₂ delivery

---

### Task 3: Safety Assessment Before Boarding (5 minutes)

**Before boarding, assess hazards:**

**External scan:**

□ **Radiation:** Scan for radiation (reactor leak?)
  - Reading: 0.5 mSv/hr (slightly elevated but not dangerous, consistent with shielded reactor)
  - Safe to approach

□ **Structural integrity:** Any hull breaches visible?
  - Exterior appears intact (no obvious holes or venting atmosphere)
  - However, cannot fully assess interior pressure without docking or hailing

□ **Temperature:** Check hull temperature (IR)
  - Hull temperature: -50°C (cold, no internal heating, consistent with power loss)
  - Crew compartment likely near freezing (if life support completely failed)

□ **Hazmat:** Any cargo hazards visible or declared on transponder?
  - Transponder weak but readable: "Cargo: Electronics and textiles" (non-hazardous)

**Captain decision:**

> "Ship appears dead but structurally intact. No immediate hazards. We're going to board. Engineer, you're with me on EVA. Pilot, you stay aboard Pathfinder and monitor. If anything goes wrong, you back off and call for help. Understood?"

Pilot: "Understood, Captain."

---

## Phase 2: Boarding and Initial Assessment (T+30:00 to T+45:00)

### Task 4: Docking or EVA Transfer (5-10 minutes)

**Two boarding options:**

**Option A: Dock (if docking ports compatible)**
- Pathfinder attempts to dock with distressed freighter
- Advantage: Pressurized transfer, easier equipment transport
- Disadvantage: Takes longer (5-10 minutes), docking mechanism may fail if freighter unpowered

**Option B: EVA Transfer**
- Captain and Engineer don EVA suits, transfer via spacewalk
- Advantage: Faster (3-5 minutes), doesn't require docking mechanism
- Disadvantage: Must carry equipment manually, limited by suit capacity

**Captain chooses:** Option B (EVA) - Faster, time is critical

**Procedure:**
1. **Suit up:** Captain and Engineer don EVA suits (5 minutes)
2. **Staging equipment:**
   - Emergency O₂ bottles: 4 bottles (2 for distressed crew immediately, 2 reserve)
   - Medical kit: First aid supplies
   - Portable radio: Communication with Pilot
   - Emergency thermal blankets: Crew may be hypothermic
   - Flashlights: Distressed ship has no power
3. **Depressurize airlock:** Pathfinder airlock (2 minutes)
4. **Transfer:** Captain and Engineer jet across 100m gap to distressed freighter (2 minutes)
5. **Entry:** Find airlock on freighter, manually crank open outer door (no power)

**Time to boarding:** 10 minutes from decision

---

### Task 5: Enter Distressed Vessel (5 minutes)

**Airlock entry (manual):**

1. **Locate airlock:** Freighter has airlock on port side (standard location)
2. **Manual override:** Outer door has manual crank (for emergency, bypasses power)
3. **Crank open:** Takes 2-3 minutes of manual labor (hand-cranking)
4. **Enter airlock:** Captain and Engineer enter airlock with equipment
5. **Close outer door:** Manually crank closed (seal behind them)
6. **Check pressure:** Airlock pressure gauge (if readable without power):
   - Pressure: 65 kPa (low, but present - ship not fully depressurized)
   - Enough pressure to breathe IF O₂ concentration adequate (but it's not - 12% O₂)
7. **Open inner door:** Manually crank open inner door, enter ship interior

**Inside ship observations:**

**Environment:**
- **Lighting:** Complete darkness (no power, no emergency lights working)
- **Temperature:** Estimated -10°C (cold, crew will be hypothermic)
- **Pressure:** Suit gauge shows 65 kPa (low but livable if O₂ concentration OK)
- **O₂ level:** Suit sensor reads 9% O₂ (dropped further since distress call - CRITICAL)
- **Sounds:** Silence (no hum of machinery, life support, or ventilation)

Captain (via radio to Pilot): "We're inside. No power, dark, cold. O₂ is down to 9%. Looking for crew now."

---

### Task 6: Locate Crew (5 minutes)

**Search pattern:**

Use flashlights, search ship systematically:
- **Bridge:** Empty (no one at controls)
- **Engineering:** Empty (no one at reactor controls)
- **Crew quarters:** FOUND ALL 3 CREW

**Crew condition:**

**Crew Member 1 (Captain of distressed vessel):**
- Position: Lying on bunk in quarters
- Consciousness: Unconscious, unresponsive
- Breathing: Shallow, labored (hypoxia)
- Pulse: Weak, 110 bpm (tachycardia from hypoxia)
- Skin: Pale, lips blue (cyanosis)
- Temperature: Cold to touch (hypothermia)

**Crew Member 2 (Engineer):**
- Position: Slumped against wall near quarters
- Consciousness: Semi-conscious, moaning, confused
- Breathing: Gasping, rapid
- Pulse: Rapid, 120 bpm
- Skin: Pale, sweating despite cold
- Temperature: Cold

**Crew Member 3 (Cargo specialist):**
- Position: Lying on deck in corridor
- Consciousness: Unconscious, not breathing
- Pulse: None palpable (cardiac arrest)
- Skin: Gray, cold
- Estimated time unconscious: 15-20 minutes (hypoxia progressed to cardiac arrest)

**Triage assessment (immediate):**

Rescue Captain: "Engineer, Crew Member 3 is in cardiac arrest. Start CPR. I'll get O₂ to the other two immediately."

---

## Critical Decision Point #2 (T+45:00 to T+50:00)

**Resource allocation: Three crew members, limited O₂, limited rescuers**

### Triage Protocol

**Standard triage categories:**

**Red (Immediate):** Life-threatening but savable
- Crew Members 1 and 2: Hypoxia, unconscious or semi-conscious, but breathing
- Treatment: O₂ immediately, warming, monitoring

**Black (Deceased/Expectant):** Dead or unlikely to survive
- Crew Member 3: Cardiac arrest, no pulse, not breathing for 15-20 minutes
- Treatment: CPR may be attempted, but survival unlikely (brain damage from prolonged hypoxia)

**Rescue Captain's decision:**

**Option 1:** Focus on Crew Members 1 and 2 (Red - most likely to survive)
- Administer O₂ to both immediately
- Warm and stabilize
- Do NOT attempt CPR on Crew Member 3 (resources inadequate, survival unlikely)
- Rationale: Save two lives vs. attempting to save one with low probability and losing others

**Option 2:** Attempt CPR on Crew Member 3 while treating others
- Engineer performs CPR on Crew Member 3
- Rescue Captain administers O₂ to Crew Members 1 and 2
- Attempt to save all three
- Rationale: Don't give up on anyone, try everything

**Option 3:** Prioritize Crew Member 2 (semi-conscious) only
- Most responsive, highest survival probability
- Give all resources to most salvageable
- Rationale: Ensure at least one survivor

**Correct answer: Option 1 (Focus on Crew Members 1 and 2)**

**Rationale:**
- Crew Members 1 and 2 have high survival probability with O₂
- Crew Member 3 has very low survival probability (prolonged hypoxia → brain death likely)
- CPR requires one rescuer's full attention (Engineer), leaving only Rescue Captain for other two
- Resources (O₂, time, hands) are limited
- Standard triage: Save the most lives possible

**Rescue Captain: "Crew Member 3 is too far gone. We focus on these two. Get O₂ on them now."**

---

## Phase 3: Emergency Treatment (T+50:00 to T+75:00)

### Treatment of Crew Member 1 (Unconscious Freighter Captain)

**Immediate actions:**

1. **Administer O₂:**
   - Open emergency O₂ bottle
   - Place mask over face (from emergency bottle valve)
   - Flow rate: High (10-15 liters/minute - deliver max O₂)
   - Expected response: Within 2-5 minutes, should regain consciousness as O₂ levels restore

2. **Warm:**
   - Wrap in emergency thermal blanket
   - Body heat from rescuers (if possible)
   - Goal: Prevent further hypothermia, raise body temp to 35-37°C

3. **Monitor:**
   - Pulse: Check every 2 minutes (should stabilize as O₂ restores)
   - Breathing: Should improve (deeper, more regular)
   - Consciousness: Should regain within 5-10 minutes

**After 5 minutes:**
- Crew Member 1 begins to stir, coughs, opens eyes
- Confused, disoriented (normal after hypoxia)
- Breathing improving
- Pulse: 95 bpm (improving)

Crew Member 1 (weakly): "What... where...?"

Rescue Captain: "You're safe. We're rescue. Just breathe. You're going to be OK."

---

### Treatment of Crew Member 2 (Semi-Conscious Engineer)

**Immediate actions:**

1. **Administer O₂:**
   - Emergency O₂ bottle with mask
   - High flow rate

2. **Warm:**
   - Emergency thermal blanket

3. **Monitor:**
   - More responsive than Crew Member 1 (semi-conscious already)
   - With O₂, should become fully conscious quickly

**After 3 minutes:**
- Crew Member 2 fully conscious
- Breathing normally
- Talking coherently
- Pulse: 90 bpm (normal)

Crew Member 2: "Thank God... I thought we were dead... sent distress call... don't know if anyone heard..."

Rescue Engineer: "We heard. You're going to be OK. Just rest and breathe."

---

### Crew Member 3 (Cardiac Arrest)

**Decision:** Do not attempt CPR (triage decision)

**Confirmation of death:**
- No pulse
- No breathing
- Fixed, dilated pupils (brain death)
- Body cold (hypothermia + cardiac arrest + prolonged hypoxia = no viable resuscitation)

**Rescue Captain documents:**
- Time of death confirmed: T+50:00 (approximately 10:45 ship time)
- Cause: Hypoxia (from life support failure) progressing to cardiac arrest
- Unable to resuscitate (prolonged hypoxia, inadequate resources)

**Emotional impact:** Rescue crew feels guilt/sadness (couldn't save everyone)
**Captain reassures:** "We did what we could. We saved two lives. Crew Member 3 was already gone before we arrived."

---

### Stabilization (T+60:00 to T+75:00)

**Crew Members 1 and 2 stabilize with O₂ and warming:**

**After 15 minutes of O₂:**
- Both fully conscious
- Breathing normally
- Pulse normal
- Temperature improving (but still cold, will take hours to fully rewarm)

**Medical assessment:**

**Crew Member 1:**
- Hypoxia (resolved with O₂)
- Mild hypothermia (improving)
- No apparent permanent damage
- Needs continued O₂, monitoring for 2-4 hours
- Hospital evaluation recommended (check for brain/heart damage from hypoxia)

**Crew Member 2:**
- Hypoxia (resolved)
- Mild hypothermia (improving)
- No apparent permanent damage
- Same recommendations as Crew Member 1

**Crew Member 3:**
- Deceased
- Body will be transported back for family, investigation

---

## Phase 4: Investigation and Causation (T+75:00 to T+90:00)

**Once crew stabilized, investigate what caused life support failure:**

### Interview Survivors

**Rescue Captain asks:** "What happened to your ship?"

**Crew Member 2 (Freighter Engineer) explains:**

> "We were running normal, just cruising. Then about an hour ago, we heard a loud bang from engineering. I ran back and saw smoke. Electrical fire in the power distribution panel. I hit it with the CO₂ extinguisher, put it out quick. But the fire damaged the main breaker panel."
>
> "Lost main power. Reactor scrammed automatically. We switched to battery backup, but batteries only last so long. After 30 minutes, batteries were dying. Life support went off-line. O₂ stopped being produced. We tried to restart the reactor manually, but the control panel was dead - no power to controls."
>
> "I sent distress call on emergency radio (runs on separate battery). But then that battery died too. We tried to stay calm, but O₂ kept dropping. Got down to 12%, I was getting dizzy. I remember thinking 'This is it,' and then... I don't remember. Next thing I know, you're here."

**Root Cause:** Electrical fire → Power distribution failure → Lost reactor → Backup batteries depleted → Life support offline → Hypoxia

**Contributing Factors:**
- Electrical fire (age-related equipment failure? Poor maintenance?)
- No secondary backup power (some ships have generator or solar panels)
- No emergency O₂ bottles accessible (or crew couldn't reach them in time)
- Older ship (Frontier-Class 20+ years old, may have deferred maintenance)

---

### Inspect Distressed Ship (if time permits)

**Rescue Engineer inspects engineering:**

**Findings:**
- Power distribution panel: Burned out (fire damage), multiple breakers melted
- Reactor: Safed (SCRAM successful), structurally OK
- Batteries: Completely depleted (0% charge)
- Emergency O₂ bottles: Found in storage locker, but locker was locked and crew didn't have key accessible (poor emergency prep)

**Assessment:**
- Ship is repairable (replace power distribution panel, recharge batteries, restart reactor)
- But requires professional repair (student ship cannot repair)
- Will need to tow distressed ship to port OR leave it here and return with tow ship

---

## Phase 5: Rescue Completion and Transport (T+90:00 to T+120:00)

### Task 7: Transport Survivors

**Options for transporting survivors:**

**Option A:** Transfer survivors to Pathfinder (student ship)
- Pathfinder capacity: 3 crew (already full) + 2 survivors = 5 people total
- Life support capacity: Pathfinder designed for 3, can support 5 for short term (2-3 days)
- Pros: Survivors safe, warm, monitored
- Cons: Crowded, life support strained

**Option B:** Repair distressed freighter, restore life support
- Would require: Replace power panel, recharge batteries, restart reactor
- Time: 4-8 hours (if parts available, which they're not)
- Not viable (student ship doesn't have spare power panel for freighter)

**Rescue Captain chooses:** Option A (transfer survivors to Pathfinder)

**Transfer procedure:**
1. Survivors don spare EVA suits (from distressed freighter's locker)
2. EVA transfer to Pathfinder (100m spacewalk, guided by rescue crew)
3. Bring emergency supplies from distressed freighter (food, water, any useful gear)
4. Crew Member 3 (deceased) also transferred (body bag, will be returned to family)

**Transfer complete at T+105:00**

---

### Task 8: Secure Distressed Vessel

**Before leaving distressed freighter:**

□ **Collect data recorder:** Ship's log, black box (if equipped) - for investigation
□ **Close airlocks:** Secure ship (prevent further atmosphere loss, protect from debris)
□ **Mark position:** Note precise coordinates for salvage/tow later
□ **Notify authorities:** Report ship location, condition, plan for salvage

**Distressed freighter status:** Abandoned but secured, drifting at known coordinates

---

### Task 9: Notify Authorities and Arrange Tow

**Rescue Captain transmits on 121.5 MHz:**

> "This is Pathfinder, registry NX-4729. We have responded to distress call from freighter Stellar Dawn, registry [obtained from survivors]. We have rescued two survivors, one deceased. Freighter is disabled, location [coordinates], drifting. Survivors being transported to [nearest station]. Freighter will require salvage tow. Over."

**Response (may take hours to receive, if out of immediate range):**

> "Pathfinder, this is Rescue Coordination Center. Acknowledge your report. Good work on the rescue. We are dispatching salvage tow to freighter location, ETA 48 hours. Proceed to [nearest station] with survivors for medical evaluation. Please provide full report upon arrival. Out."

---

### Task 10: Return to Course

**With survivors aboard:**

1. **Life support adjustment:**
   - APU set to higher O₂ production (5 people, not 3)
   - Monitor O₂ and CO₂ closely (ensure adequate for increased crew)
   - Estimated duration: 2 days to nearest station (life support adequate)

2. **Medical monitoring:**
   - Check survivors every 4 hours (pulse, breathing, mental status)
   - Continue O₂ supplementation for 8-12 hours (ensure full recovery)
   - Watch for delayed hypoxia effects (confusion, seizures)

3. **Emotional support:**
   - Survivors traumatized (near-death experience, lost crewmate)
   - Provide comfort, food, rest
   - Avoid blame ("You should have done X") - not helpful now

4. **Resume original mission (delayed):**
   - Original cargo delivery will be 2-3 days late (diverted for rescue, then detour to station)
   - Notify cargo recipient of delay (emergency rescue, unavoidable)
   - Most contracts have force majeure clause (emergency excuses delay)

---

## Debriefing and Assessment (After Rescue Complete)

### Scoring Criteria

**Optimal Performance (95-100 points):**
- Responded to distress call immediately (correct decision)
- Efficient location and approach (minimal time)
- Proper safety assessment before boarding
- Correct triage (prioritized Crew Members 1 and 2)
- Effective treatment (O₂, warming, monitoring)
- Successful rescue of 2 survivors
- Proper handling of deceased crew member
- Thorough investigation of causation
- Proper notification of authorities
- Emotional support for survivors and own crew

**Excellent Performance (85-94 points):**
- Responded to distress call (correct)
- Timely location and approach (some delays)
- Safety assessment adequate
- Correct or reasonable triage
- Effective treatment (2 survivors saved)
- Most procedures followed correctly

**Acceptable Performance (70-84 points):**
- Responded to distress call (correct)
- Located distressed vessel (with some difficulty)
- Safety adequate (no injuries to rescue crew)
- Triage debatable but survivors saved
- Treatment effective (2 survivors saved)

**Marginal Performance (50-69 points):**
- Responded to distress call but hesitated
- Difficulty locating or approaching
- Triage errors but at least one survivor saved
- Treatment partially effective

**Failure (<50 points):**
- Did not respond to distress call (0 points, major ethical/legal failure)
- Or responded but rescue crew injured/killed (safety violations)
- Or no survivors saved (treatment errors)

### Key Learning Points

1. **Duty to Rescue:**
   - Maritime law obligates vessels to render assistance
   - Moral obligation to help others in distress
   - Balance helping others vs. own ship safety (help if able without excessive risk)

2. **Triage Under Resource Constraints:**
   - Cannot save everyone with limited resources
   - Prioritize those most likely to survive
   - Difficult but necessary decisions
   - "Greatest good for greatest number"

3. **Hypoxia Recognition and Treatment:**
   - <16% O₂: Hypoxia symptoms (confusion, unconsciousness)
   - <10% O₂: Cardiac arrest, death
   - Treatment: O₂ immediately, high flow
   - Time is critical (brain damage after 4-6 minutes without O₂)

4. **Hypothermia Management:**
   - Space is cold (ships without power freeze quickly)
   - Hypothermia compounds hypoxia (body shuts down)
   - Warm survivors (blankets, body heat, warm environment)

5. **Investigation and Reporting:**
   - Understand what happened (prevent recurrence)
   - Document for authorities, insurance, legal
   - Learn from incident (improve safety)

6. **Emotional Resilience:**
   - Rescue work is stressful (life-and-death decisions)
   - Cannot save everyone (accept limitations)
   - Debrief after incident (process emotions)
   - Celebrate successes (2 lives saved is success, even if 1 lost)

### Post-Scenario Discussion

**Instructor questions:**

1. **"How did you feel when you realized you couldn't save Crew Member 3?"**
   - Explore emotions (guilt, sadness, frustration)
   - Normalize these feelings (appropriate response)
   - Reinforce: Did the right thing (saved 2 vs. trying to save all 3 and possibly failing)

2. **"What if your own ship had life support issues too? Would you still respond?"**
   - Explore risk assessment (help others vs. endanger self)
   - Discuss acceptable risk levels

3. **"What could the distressed freighter crew have done differently?"**
   - Better emergency preparedness (accessible O₂ bottles, backup power)
   - Regular maintenance (prevent electrical fires)
   - Faster emergency response (maybe save Crew Member 3 if called sooner)

4. **"What would you do if you couldn't locate the distressed vessel?"**
   - Search patterns, expanding radius
   - Call for additional help (other ships, rescue services)
   - At what point do you give up? (Difficult question, no easy answer)

## Variations for Repeated Training

**To prevent memorization, vary scenario:**

1. **Different emergency:** Fire instead of life support failure
2. **More/fewer survivors:** 1 survivor, or 5 survivors (resource strain)
3. **Distressed ship hazards:** Radiation leak, cargo hazard, unstable structure
4. **Own ship issues:** Rescue ship develops problem mid-rescue (forces prioritization)
5. **Ethical dilemmas:** Survivor is criminal, or survivor wants to stay with ship (refuses rescue)

**Instructor Notes:** This scenario has no "easy" answers. Triage decisions are emotionally difficult. Students may second-guess their decisions (should we have tried CPR? Could we have saved all three?). Emphasize: They did the best they could with available resources and information. Two lives saved is a success. Crew Member 3 was likely unrecoverable before they arrived. This is realistic - rescue work involves hard choices and imperfect outcomes. Build emotional resilience through discussion and support.

**Recommended Debrief Time:** 30 minutes after scenario. Discuss feelings, decisions, what they'd do differently. Provide psychological support (this scenario can be emotionally taxing).

**Real-World Application:** Outer Rim has limited rescue resources. Private vessels often must respond to distress calls. This scenario prepares crews for real emergencies they may encounter. Emphasize: Your response may be the only chance someone has. Be prepared, be trained, be willing to help.
