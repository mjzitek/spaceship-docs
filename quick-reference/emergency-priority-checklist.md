## Emergency Response Priority Matrix

**When multiple emergencies occur simultaneously, prioritize in this order:**

### 1. LIFE SAFETY (Highest Priority)
- Crew evacuation from immediate danger
- Emergency oxygen for crew
- Stop life-threatening situations (fire, decompression)
- Medical response to injured crew

### 2. SHIP SAFETY
- Prevent ship destruction or catastrophic damage
- Reactor SCRAM if required
- Seal breaches
- Fire suppression

### 3. SYSTEM RESTORATION
- Restore critical systems (life support, propulsion)
- Activate backup systems
- Emergency repairs

### 4. MISSION CONTINUATION
- Navigate to safety
- Request assistance
- Plan for recovery

**ALWAYS: Crew lives over ship, ship over mission, property over pride**

## First 60 Seconds - Universal Emergency Response

**No matter the emergency, these steps apply:**

### 0-10 Seconds: ASSESS
- [ ] What is the emergency?
- [ ] Where is it located?
- [ ] Is anyone injured or in immediate danger?
- [ ] Is it getting worse?

### 10-20 Seconds: ALERT
- [ ] Sound appropriate alarm
- [ ] Announce emergency on ship intercom
- [ ] Account for all crew
- [ ] Send distress signal (if life-threatening)

### 20-40 Seconds: ACT (Initial Response)
- [ ] Implement immediate safety measures
- [ ] Evacuate endangered crew
- [ ] Don emergency equipment (oxygen, suits, etc.)
- [ ] Contain problem if possible (seal compartment, cut power, etc.)

### 40-60 Seconds: ASSESS AGAIN
- [ ] Is situation stabilized, worsening, or unchanged?
- [ ] What resources are needed?
- [ ] What's the next action?

3. Check for injuries (crew)
4. Check for fire (electrical)
5. Seal damaged compartments

**See:** EMERG-025 (Collision Damage)

### NAVIGATION FAILURE
**First 2 Minutes:**
1. Emergency stop or safe trajectory
2. Check backup navigation systems
3. Verify position if possible
4. Check for collision hazards
5. Send position request if communications available

**See:** EMERG-030 (Navigation Failure)

## Emergency Equipment Locations

**Every crew member should know:**

### Emergency Oxygen
- **Location**: Emergency stations (typically every compartment)
- **Duration**: 15-30 minutes per mask
- **Use**: Any smoke, fumes, low oxygen, or decompression

### Fire Extinguishers
- **Location**: Every compartment, near exits
- **Type**: ABC multi-purpose (most common)
- **Use**: Small fires, electrical safe

### Medical Kit
- **Location**: Medical bay, bridge, engineering
- **Contents**: First aid, trauma supplies, medications
- **Use**: Injuries, illness, exposure

### Emergency Suits/EVA Suits
- **Location**: Airlock, emergency locker
- **Use**: Decompression, radiation, toxic atmosphere, EVA

### Emergency Beacon
- **Location**: Bridge, communications panel
- **Activation**: Automatic or manual
- **Use**: Broadcasts distress and position

---

## Distress Signal Priority

**Send distress signal immediately if:**

- Life support failing with limited reserves
- Reactor containment breach
- Severe crew injuries requiring medical facility
- Ship breaking up or structural failure
- Lost and cannot determine position
- Any situation where survival beyond X hours uncertain

**Distress Signal Types:**

**MAYDAY** - Immediate life-threatening emergency
- Ship sinking/breaking up
- Life support failing
- Reactor breach
- Medical emergency requiring immediate rescue

**PAN-PAN** - Urgent situation, not immediately life-threatening
- System failures affecting safety
- Navigation failure
- Propulsion failure
- Medical situation requiring assistance but not immediate

**SECURITÉ** - Safety information
- Navigational hazard warning
- Debris field warning
- Storm/radiation warning

---

## Emergency Decision Trees

### "Should I SCRAM the reactor?"

**SCRAM immediately if:**
- Core temperature >3,000°C
- Coolant pressure <40 PSI
- Radiation >2.0 mSv/h outside shielding
- Containment breach imminent (E-PWR-251)
- Multiple critical alarms
- Fire in reactor compartment

**Consider SCRAM if:**
- Core temperature >2,900°C and rising
- Coolant pressure <60 PSI and dropping
- Severe plasma instability
- Loss of control over reactor

**Do NOT SCRAM if:**
- Parameters within normal range
- Single non-critical alarm
- Issue can be resolved without shutdown

**Note:** SCRAM is emergency shutdown - causes thermal stress and requires inspection before restart. Use when necessary for safety, but not prematurely.

### "Should I evacuate and seal a compartment?"

**Evacuate immediately if:**
- Fire out of control
- Rapid decompression
- Toxic fumes/chemicals
- Radiation levels dangerous
- Structural collapse imminent

**Consider evacuation if:**
- Fire spreading despite suppression efforts
- Slow decompression and patch not accessible
- Chemical leak that cannot be contained
- System failure that could escalate

**Do NOT evacuate if:**
- Issue can be safely resolved with crew present
- Equipment needed in compartment to resolve issue
- Evacuation would endanger crew more than staying

### "Should I send distress signal?"

**Send immediately if:**
- Crew will run out of critical resources (oxygen, power, etc.) before reaching safety
- Ship cannot navigate to safety (propulsion, navigation failed)
- Crew injuries requiring medical facility
- Any "MAYDAY" level emergency

**Send when convenient if:**
- Non-critical systems failed but ship operational
- Requesting guidance or information
- Notifying of navigational hazard

**Do NOT send distress if:**
- Issue resolved or resolving
- Ship can reach port on own power
- Resources adequate for voyage
- Issue is minor inconvenience

## Common Emergency Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Hesitating when immediate action required**
- Decompression and fire require <30 second response
- Seconds count - act decisively

❌ **Not accounting for all crew**
- Before sealing compartment, verify crew evacuated
- Before depressurizing, confirm no crew inside

❌ **Fighting fire alone or without breathing protection**
- Always have backup crew member
- Always wear breathing protection (smoke kills)

❌ **Entering hazardous areas without protection**
- Radiation requires protection
- Toxic atmosphere requires breathing equipment
- Decompression requires pressure suit

❌ **Not sending distress signal early enough**
- Better to call for help and not need it
- Better early than too late
- Rescuers need time to respond

❌ **Panic**
- Panic causes mistakes and worsens situation
- Take breath, think, then act
- Follow procedures - they work

❌ **Ignoring "minor" warnings that escalate**
- Small problems become big emergencies
- Warning level issues can become critical
- Address issues promptly

### Immediate Post-Emergency Actions

1. **Account for all crew:**
   - Verify all crew safe and accounted for
   - Assess injuries and provide medical care
   - Check crew for exposure (radiation, chemicals)

2. **Assess ship status:**
   - What systems damaged or offline?
   - What repairs needed immediately vs. later?
   - Can ship continue operations safely?

3. **Secure scene:**
   - Ensure emergency won't reignite or recur
   - Monitor for 15+ minutes (fires can re-ignite)
   - Keep emergency equipment ready

4. **Document incident:**
   - What happened, when, where?
   - What actions taken?
   - What damage sustained?
   - Crew exposure or injuries?

5. **Plan next steps:**
   - Continue voyage or head to port?
   - What systems need repair before operating?
   - Report required to authorities?

6. **Debrief crew:**
   - What went well?
   - What could be improved?
   - Lessons learned for future
