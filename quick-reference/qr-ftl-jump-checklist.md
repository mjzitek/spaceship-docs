# Quick Reference: FTL Jump Checklist

**Document ID:** QR-FTL-001
**Revision:** 1.3
**Last Updated:** 2847.09.14

## Pre-Jump Verification (5 minutes)

### Power Systems
- [ ] Q-Core reactor at ≥80% capacity
- [ ] No power system error codes
- [ ] Reactor temperature 1,800-2,400°C

### FTL Drive Status
- [ ] FTL panel shows "FTL READY"
- [ ] All 16 tachyon emitters GREEN
- [ ] QFM temperature <600°C
- [ ] Cooldown timer at 00:00:00

### Position and Clearance
- [ ] Minimum 2 AU from nearest star
- [ ] Minimum 100,000 km from planets
- [ ] Minimum 1,000 km from stations/asteroids
- [ ] Navigation shows "CLEAR FOR JUMP"

### Vessel Preparation
- [ ] All crew secured at stations or in quarters
- [ ] Cargo secured for jump forces
- [ ] All hatches sealed
- [ ] No EVA activities in progress
- [ ] Hull integrity 100% (no breaches)

### Navigation
- [ ] Destination coordinates verified
- [ ] Jump distance within drive range:
  - Horizon-1: ≤20 light-years
  - Horizon-2: ≤50 light-years
  - Horizon-3: ≤100 light-years
- [ ] Navigation computer has calculated tunnel vector
- [ ] Command authorization obtained (if required)

## FTL Charge Sequence (20-60 minutes)

### Initiate Charge
- [ ] Press "FTL CHARGE" button
- [ ] Monitor charge progress 0→100%
- [ ] Estimated time displayed

### Monitor During Charge
- [ ] Tachyon field intensity rising smoothly to 450-600 TU
- [ ] Field symmetry ≥97%
- [ ] All 16 emitters balanced
- [ ] QFM ramping to 800-1,200°C
- [ ] Graviton compensators activate at 75% charge

### At 90% Charge
- [ ] Navigation computer locks on destination
- [ ] "NAV LOCK" indicator GREEN
- [ ] No warning messages

### At 100% Charge
- [ ] "READY FOR JUMP" displayed
- [ ] All systems GREEN and stable
- [ ] Reactor power steady

## Jump Execution (15 seconds)

### Final Checks
- [ ] Reactor stable
- [ ] Tachyon field stable
- [ ] Nav lock confirmed
- [ ] No new warnings
- [ ] Crew secured confirmation

### Execute
- [ ] Press "EXECUTE JUMP" button (yellow)
- [ ] Countdown 10 seconds begins
- [ ] At zero: Automatic jump initiation

### Jump Entry Confirms
- [ ] Brief disorientation (normal)
- [ ] Status: "IN FTL TRANSIT"
- [ ] Tunnel stability 95-99%
- [ ] Estimated time to destination displayed

## In-Transit Monitoring

### Check Every 30 Minutes
- [ ] Tunnel stability ≥90%
- [ ] QFM temperature 800-1,200°C
- [ ] Tachyon field 450-600 TU
- [ ] Graviton compensator load 40-70%
- [ ] Q-Core power steady
- [ ] No unusual vibrations

### Warning Thresholds
- **Stability <95%**: Increase tachyon field +25 TU
- **Stability <90%**: Prepare for possible abort
- **QFM >1,400°C**: Reduce power 10%
- **Compensator >90%**: Monitor closely, may abort

## Jump Exit (30 seconds)

### At 5 Minutes Warning
- [ ] Alert crew to prepare
- [ ] Inertial dampeners maximum
- [ ] Sublight engines in standby
- [ ] Sensors ready

### Exit Confirms
- [ ] Status: "FTL EXIT COMPLETE"
- [ ] Verify position vs. destination
- [ ] Spatial drift ≤0.01% of distance
- [ ] All systems nominal

## Post-Jump (5 minutes)

- [ ] FTL drive entering cooldown
- [ ] Scan local area for hazards
- [ ] Verify arrived at correct destination
- [ ] Log jump in ship's record
- [ ] Note cooldown timer started:
  - Horizon-1: 8 hours
  - Horizon-2: 6 hours
  - Horizon-3: 4 hours

## Emergency Abort

**Press red "FTL ABORT" button if:**
- Tunnel stability <85%
- QFM temperature >1,600°C
- Graviton compensator ≥95%
- Critical system failure
- Crew safety threatened

**Expected:**
- Rough exit from tunnel
- Spatial position uncertain
- Drive requires inspection before next jump

## Common Error Codes

- **E-NAV-501**: Insufficient power (increase reactor)
- **E-NAV-502**: Mass shadow (move to clear zone)
- **E-NAV-503**: Cooldown active (must wait)
- **E-NAV-504**: Nav lock failed (check coordinates)
- **E-NAV-505**: Emitter failure (reset or repair)

## Cooldown Periods (Non-Overridable)

- **Horizon-1**: 8 hours minimum
- **Horizon-2**: 6 hours minimum
- **Horizon-3**: 4 hours minimum

## Power Requirements

- **Horizon-1**: 20-25 MW
- **Horizon-2**: 70-80 MW
- **Horizon-3**: 160-180 MW

**SAFETY REMINDER**: Never rush jump preparation. Verify all checklist items. Better to delay than risk catastrophic failure.
