## Abort Criteria

**DO NOT DEPART if any of the following are true:**

### MANDATORY ABORT (Unsafe to depart):
- Life support failure (O₂ <18%, no backup)
- Reactor critical failure or radiation leak
- Hull breach unresolved
- Fire uncontrolled
- Multiple critical system failures
- Crew incapacitated or medically unfit
- Weather/space conditions unsafe (if in atmosphere or hazardous region)

### RECOMMENDED ABORT (Should not depart):
- Navigation system failure (cannot navigate safely)
- Communications total failure (cannot call for help)
- Propulsion severely degraded (<50% thrust)
- Cargo unsecured or improperly loaded
- Clearances not obtained (legal requirement)

### CONDITIONAL ABORT (Assess risk):
- Single non-critical system degraded (can compensate)
- Minor equipment malfunction (does not affect safety)
- Crew concerns about readiness (listen to crew intuition)

**If in doubt, delay departure.** It is always safer to delay and resolve issues than to launch with known problems.

   - Captain/Pilot signature
   - Any discrepancies noted and resolution

2. **Ship's log entry:**
   - Departure recorded
   - Pre-flight status: Systems green, crew ready
   - Fuel, water, supplies: Quantities logged

3. **Flight plan:**

## Checklist Variations by Journey Type

### Local Flight (<1 day, nearby destination)
- **Abbreviated checklist acceptable** (30 minutes)
- Focus on: Power, life support, navigation, communications
- Can skip: Comprehensive cargo check (if unchanged), extended emergency supplies check

### Long Journey (>3 days, distant destination)
- **Comprehensive checklist mandatory** (60-90 minutes)
- Extra attention to: Supplies (food, water, O₂), life support reliability, backup systems
- Verify: All emergency equipment, spare parts adequate

### High-Risk Journey (dangerous space, pirate region, first flight after repairs)
- **Extended checklist recommended** (90+ minutes)
- Extra checks: Hull integrity, security systems, weapons (if armed), escape pods
- Crew briefing: Emergency procedures, rally points, abandon ship plan

### Routine Short Hop (same route flown regularly, <1 hour)
- **Expedited checklist permitted** (15-20 minutes)
- Focus on: System status check (all green?), fuel adequate, communications working
- **Caution:** Don't get complacent. Even routine flights can have surprises.

## Tips for Efficient Pre-Flight

**Develop a routine:**
- Same sequence every time (builds muscle memory)
- Assign crew roles (engineer checks power, pilot checks navigation, etc.)
- Use this checklist until internalized

**Don't rush:**
- Allocate adequate time (plan departure 1 hour before needed, not last-minute)
- If passenger/cargo anxious to depart, explain safety necessity
- A thorough pre-flight prevents in-flight emergencies

**If discrepancy found:**
- Assess: Can it be resolved quickly? Is it safe to depart?
- When in doubt: Delay departure, investigate/repair
- Document: All discrepancies and resolutions

**Learn from incidents:**
- If something goes wrong in flight, consider: Would pre-flight have caught it?
- Update personal checklist with lessons learned
- Share with crew (continuous improvement)

**Remember:**
> "An hour on the ground is better than a minute in space wishing you'd stayed on the ground."

Every minute spent on pre-flight is an investment in a safe journey. Skipping steps to save 10 minutes may cost hours (or lives) if something goes wrong.

**Safe travels!**
