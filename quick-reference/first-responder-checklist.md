# FIRST RESPONDER DIAGNOSTIC CHECKLIST
**For Help Desk Use | Time Limit: 2 minutes**

## PURPOSE
This checklist guides you through the critical first 2 minutes of every support call. Your goals:
1. **Assess severity** - Is this an emergency?
2. **Gather key facts** - What, when, where, how?
3. **Triage properly** - Route to correct resolution path

**Use this for EVERY call - it ensures nothing critical is missed.**

## 📞 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROTOCOL

**If SEVERITY 1 (Emergency) identified:**

### Step 1: IMMEDIATE STABILIZATION (First 30 seconds)
```
1. Stay calm - your tone sets theirs
2. "I'm going to help you. First, ensure crew safety."
3. Direct to appropriate emergency procedure:

   - FIRE → [EMERG-002](../emergency-procedures/emerg-002-fire.md)
   - HULL BREACH → [EMERG-001](../emergency-procedures/emerg-001-hull-breach.md)
   - LIFE SUPPORT → [EMERG-003](../emergency-procedures/emerg-003-life-support.md)
   - REACTOR → [EMERG-005](../emergency-procedures/emerg-005-reactor-emergency.md)
   - FTL FAILURE → [EMERG-004](../emergency-procedures/emerg-004-ftl-failure.md)
```

### Step 2: ALERT EMERGENCY RESPONSE (Next 30 seconds)
```
4. Page emergency response team: "Severity 1 - [Type] - [Ship Name]"
5. Notify Level 2 support lead
6. Keep customer on line - DO NOT TRANSFER during emergency
```

### Step 3: GUIDE CUSTOMER (Ongoing)
```
7. Read relevant emergency procedure to customer step-by-step
8. Confirm each step completed before moving to next
9. Monitor situation - update emergency team every 2 minutes
10. Stay on line until situation stabilized or emergency team takes over
```

### Step 4: DOCUMENT (After stabilization)
```
11. Record all actions taken with timestamps
12. Note customer responses and decisions
13. Document any damage, injuries, or losses
14. Complete incident report immediately after call
```

- What's the coolant pressure and temperature?
- Are there any radiation warnings?
- Which specific systems lost power?

### For LIFE SUPPORT issues:
- What are current O2 and CO2 levels?
- What's the atmospheric pressure?
- Temperature in affected areas?
- How many crew? Any symptoms?
- When was last sensor calibration?

### For NAVIGATION/FTL issues:
- Can you see your current position?

## 💡 COMMUNICATION TIPS

### DO:
- ✅ Speak clearly and calmly
- ✅ Use plain language (avoid jargon unless customer is technical)
- ✅ Confirm understanding: "Let me make sure I understand..."
- ✅ Set expectations: "This should take about X minutes"
- ✅ Acknowledge their concern: "I understand this is frustrating"
- ✅ Give them something to do: "While I check this, can you..."

### DON'T:
- ❌ Use technical jargon with non-technical customers
- ❌ Make promises you can't keep
- ❌ Blame the customer (even if it's user error)
- ❌ Say "that's impossible" or "that's never happened before"
- ❌ Leave long silences - update them every 30-60 seconds
- ❌ Rush through safety questions

## 🚨 RED FLAGS - ESCALATE IMMEDIATELY

If customer says ANY of these phrases:

- "I smell something burning"
- "I see smoke"
- "I hear an alarm"
- "Someone is hurt"
- "We're losing pressure"
- "Radiation warning is showing"
- "The hull is breached"
- "We're being attacked"
- "We can't move"
- "Systems are failing one by one"
- "Temperature is rising rapidly"
- "I've never seen this before"
- "The ship is shaking/vibrating abnormally"

**These indicate potential emergency - follow Emergency Response Protocol**

## 🎓 TRAINING NOTES

### Common New Agent Mistakes:
1. **Skipping safety questions** - Always ask about danger FIRST
2. **Jumping to solutions** - Gather info first, then diagnose
3. **Under-triaging** - When in doubt, escalate severity UP
4. **Poor documentation** - Write it down NOW, not later
5. **Not setting expectations** - Tell customer what happens next

### How to Handle Difficult Situations:
- **Panicking customer** - Stay calm, be reassuring, speak slowly
- **Angry customer** - Acknowledge, apologize, focus on solution
- **Technical customer** - Match their expertise level, skip basics
- **Non-technical customer** - Use analogies, avoid jargon
- **Language barrier** - Speak slowly, use simple words, confirm understanding

### When to Break from the Checklist:
- **Obvious emergency** - Skip straight to Emergency Protocol
- **Repeat caller** - May skip some identification questions
- **Very technical crew** - Can abbreviate intake if they provide detailed info
- **Multiple simultaneous issues** - Focus on most severe first
