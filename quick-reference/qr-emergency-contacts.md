## Quick Communication Decision Tree

**Life-Threatening Emergency?**
→ YES: 121.5 MHz (Rescue Coordination) OR Q-Link Beacon
→ NO: Continue

**Critical System Failure?**
→ YES: 121.7 MHz (ORSM Emergency Support)
→ NO: Continue

**Medical Emergency?**
→ YES: 121.6 MHz (Medical Emergency)
→ NO: Continue

**Near Station?**
→ YES: Contact Traffic Control (local frequency)
→ NO: Continue

**Need Technical Help?**
→ YES: 122.3 MHz (ORSM Non-Emergency Support)
→ NO: Continue

**Business/Admin?**
→ YES: Use appropriate business contact above
→ NO: Continue

**Just Lonely?**
→ Use personal subspace communications, chat with other pilots on common hailing frequencies (156.45 MHz is popular)

## Emergency Frequency Monitoring

**Always monitor these frequencies when in space:**

1. **121.5 MHz** - Universal Distress
   - Other vessels in distress (you may be able to assist)
   - Rescue coordination broadcasts

2. **156.45 MHz** - Channel 9 (Common Hailing)
   - Ship-to-ship communication
   - Informal traffic advisories ("Heads up, debris at coordinates X,Y,Z")
   - Social chat (relieves isolation on long journeys)

3. **Local Traffic Control** - Varies by region
   - When within 100,000 km of station, monitor their frequency
   - Traffic advisories, hazard warnings

## Preservation of Evidence

**If incident occurs requiring insurance claim or legal action:**

1. **Do NOT:**
   - Erase camera footage
   - Delete logs
   - Repair damage before documenting (if safe to delay)
   - Discard damaged parts

2. **DO:**
   - Take photos/video of damage from multiple angles
   - Export and backup system logs
   - Export and backup security camera footage
   - Note time, location, circumstances in ship's log
   - Collect witness statements from crew
   - Preserve damaged components (insurance may want to inspect)

3. **Report Within:**
   - Insurance: 24 hours
   - Authorities (if criminal): Immediately
   - ORCA (if regulatory): 72 hours

## Language and Translation

**Universal Translation Protocol (UTP)**
- Most subspace communications equipment includes basic translation
- Standard Galactic (English-based) understood at all major ports
- Outer Rim may require additional language packs

**Human Translation Services:**
- Available at most major stations (especially multicultural hubs)
- Fees vary: 50-200 credits per hour
- Needed for legal documents, complex negotiations

□ Water (14 days per crew at 2L/day)
□ First aid kit (Level 2 or higher)
□ Emergency thermal blankets (2 per crew)
□ Handheld radio (backup communications)
□ Spare parts (fuses, O-rings, filters, injectors)
□ Emergency beacon (Q-Link or standard subspace)
□ Escape pod(s) provisioned and functional
□ Fire extinguishers (appropriate for all fire classes)
□ Pressure suits or EVA suits (if crew trained)
□ Portable atmospheric monitor
□ Emergency lighting (battery powered)
□ Tools (basic mechanical and electrical)
□ Hull breach sealant and patches
□ Ship's log and critical documents (digital and physical copies)

**Check Quarterly - Replace Expired Items**

## Remember

**In an emergency:**
1. Stabilize immediate threat (stop bleeding, seal breach, SCRAM reactor)
2. Assess situation (crew status, ship status, resources available)
3. Call for help (appropriate emergency contact)
4. Follow guidance from emergency support
5. Document everything (for post-incident review, insurance, legal)

**NEVER:**
- Ignore warning alarms (investigate immediately)
- Delay calling for help (pride can kill)
- Assume "it'll be fine" (space is unforgiving)
- Operate ship with known critical failures (except to reach safety)

**ALWAYS:**
- Maintain safety equipment (test, inspect, replenish)
- Train crew on emergency procedures (quarterly drills)
- Keep emergency contact list posted and accessible
- Monitor emergency frequencies
- File flight plan with someone (so they know to look if you don't arrive)
