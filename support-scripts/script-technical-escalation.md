# Support Script: Technical Escalation to Level 2

**Document Type:** Customer Service Script
**Audience:** Level 1 Technical Support Representatives
**Last Updated:** 2847.09.14

## Purpose

This script guides Level 1 support representatives through the process of escalating technical issues to Level 2 (senior technicians) when the issue exceeds Level 1 scope or capabilities. Ensures smooth handoff, complete information transfer, and professional customer experience.

## When to Escalate to Level 2

### Mandatory Escalation Situations

**Escalate immediately when:**

1. **Issue not in KB articles or manuals**
   - You've checked all relevant KB articles and troubleshooting guides
   - Issue is unique or unusual
   - No documented solution exists

2. **Customer followed troubleshooting but issue persists**
   - Customer completed all KB steps correctly
   - Problem still not resolved
   - Requires deeper diagnosis beyond Level 1 scope

3. **Requires specialized knowledge**
   - Advanced diagnostics (oscilloscope readings, spectrum analysis, etc.)
   - Component-level repair (circuit board troubleshooting)
   - Software/firmware programming or modification
   - Uncommon ship models or custom configurations

4. **Safety-critical decision needed**
   - Repair procedure carries risk (radiation, hull breach, explosion)
   - Customer asking "is it safe to..." and you're uncertain
   - Potential liability if wrong guidance given

5. **Requires authorization**
   - Warranty exception (outside normal terms)
   - Free parts/service when policy says customer should pay
   - Expedited service or delivery
   - Any deviation from standard policy

6. **Customer specifically requests supervisor/senior tech**
   - Customer right to escalation (company policy)
   - May be frustrated with Level 1 process
   - May have specialized technical knowledge and wants peer-level discussion

7. **Multiple system failures**
   - Two or more unrelated systems failing
   - Indicates complex root cause
   - Requires systems-level thinking beyond single-component troubleshooting

### Optional Escalation Situations (Use Judgment)

**Consider escalating when:**

1. **Issue taking longer than expected**
   - Standard issue should resolve in 20-30 minutes
   - If approaching 45+ minutes with no resolution in sight
   - Customer time valuable (but don't escalate just to avoid work)

2. **You're uncertain about diagnosis**
   - Multiple possible causes, can't determine which
   - Customer symptoms don't match expected patterns
   - You're guessing rather than diagnosing

3. **Customer has unusual constraints**
   - No parts available (requires improvised solution)
   - No tools or expertise aboard (requires creative workaround)
   - Time-critical situation (cargo spoiling, life support degrading)

4. **Emotional/difficult customer**
   - Customer angry, abusive, or unreasonable
   - You've tried de-escalation techniques but not improving
   - Level 2 may have better rapport or authority
   - **Note**: Don't escalate just because customer is upset; escalate if upset AND technical complexity warrants it

## Pre-Escalation Checklist

**Before escalating, ensure you've completed these steps:**

□ **Verified basic information**
  - Ship registration, model, current location
  - Crew size, safety status
  - Cargo (if relevant to issue)

□ **Gathered symptom details**
  - What's not working (specific symptoms)
  - When started (timeline)
  - Error codes (if any)
  - What customer has tried already

□ **Attempted basic troubleshooting**
  - Checked power supply, circuit breakers
  - Verified customer describing problem accurately
  - Ruled out obvious causes (user error, simple fixes)

□ **Documented everything**
  - Call log complete with all information
  - Customer won't need to repeat information to Level 2

□ **Explained escalation to customer**
  - Customer knows they're being transferred and why
  - Customer agrees to escalation

**Do NOT escalate if:**
- You haven't tried basic troubleshooting (Level 2 will send it back)
- Information is incomplete (wastes Level 2's time)
- Issue is actually in KB articles but you didn't check thoroughly

## Escalation Process

### Step 1: Explain to Customer (Set Expectations)

**Script:**

> "[CUSTOMER NAME], based on what you've described, I want to make sure you get the best possible help for this issue. I'm going to connect you with one of our senior technicians who specializes in [SYSTEM]. They'll have more advanced diagnostic tools and experience with this type of problem."

**Alternative (if customer asked for supervisor):**

> "I understand you'd like to speak with a supervisor. I'm going to connect you with [LEVEL 2 NAME], one of our senior technicians. They'll be able to help you further."

**Manage wait time:**

> "It may take a moment to connect you. Please stay on the line and I'll get you connected as quickly as possible."

**If no Level 2 immediately available:**

> "Our senior technician is currently assisting another customer. I have two options for you: you can hold for approximately [TIME ESTIMATE], or I can have them call you back within [TIME FRAME]. Which would you prefer?"

### Step 2: Brief Level 2 Technician (Warm Handoff)

**Critical**: Do NOT blind-transfer customer. Always brief Level 2 first.

**Contact Level 2:**
- Put customer on hold
- Call/message Level 2 on internal line
- Provide brief summary (30-60 seconds max)

**Briefing Template:**

> "Hi [LEVEL 2 NAME], I have an escalation for you. Customer is [CUSTOMER NAME], ship reg [REGISTRATION], [SHIP MODEL]. They're experiencing [BRIEF SYMPTOM SUMMARY]. I've already tried [WHAT YOU'VE DONE]. [ANY CRITICAL SAFETY OR TIME INFO]. Are you ready to take the call?"

**Example:**

> "Hi Sarah, I have an escalation. Customer is Captain Chen, ship NX-7243, Frontier-class freighter. They're experiencing reactor low power output, currently at 35%. I've already checked fuel levels (adequate), coolant (normal), and ran basic diagnostics (no obvious errors). No immediate safety issue but they're on battery backup now, maybe 4 hours remaining. Ready to take them?"

**Level 2 Confirms:**
> "Got it, transfer them over."

### Step 3: Transfer Customer with Introduction

**Return to customer line:**

> "[CUSTOMER NAME], thank you for holding. I have [LEVEL 2 NAME], one of our senior technicians, on the line. [LEVEL 2 NAME] specializes in [SYSTEM] and I've briefed them on your situation. They'll take it from here."

**Conference in Level 2 (three-way briefly):**

> "[LEVEL 2 NAME], this is [CUSTOMER NAME]. [CUSTOMER NAME], meet [LEVEL 2 NAME]."

**Level 2 takes over:**

Level 2: "Hi [CUSTOMER NAME], I understand you're having [ISSUE]. Let me help you with that."

**You exit call:**

> "You're in good hands, [CUSTOMER NAME]. Safe travels."

**Drop off call**

### Step 4: Document Escalation

**Update call log immediately:**

**Required information:**
- **Escalation Time**: [timestamp]
- **Escalated To**: [Level 2 name]
- **Reason for Escalation**: [brief reason]
- **Information Provided to Level 2**: [summary]
- **Customer Informed**: Yes
- **Status**: Transferred to Level 2

**Example:**
```
Escalation Time: 14:35
Escalated To: Sarah Martinez (Level 2)
Reason: Reactor low power, basic troubleshooting unsuccessful
Info Provided: Ship NX-7243, 35% reactor output, 4 hrs battery backup, fuel/coolant normal
Customer Informed: Yes
Status: Transferred to Level 2, warm handoff completed
```

## Special Escalation Scenarios

### Scenario A: Customer Angry/Demanding Escalation

**Customer says:** "This isn't working! I want to talk to your supervisor NOW!"

**Don't:**
- Get defensive ("I'm trying to help you!")
- Argue ("You don't need a supervisor")
- Take it personally

**Do:**

**Script:**

> "I understand you're frustrated, and I want to make sure this gets resolved for you. I'm happy to connect you with a senior technician right now. Let me get them on the line."

**Then proceed with standard escalation process**

**Remember:**
- Customer has RIGHT to escalation (company policy)
- Don't feel like failure (sometimes customer just wants different perspective)
- Stay professional, don't let emotion affect you

---

### Scenario B: No Level 2 Available (All Busy)

**If all Level 2 techs are on calls:**

**Option 1: Customer Holds**

**Script:**

> "Our senior technician is currently assisting another customer. I estimate a wait time of approximately [TIME]. Are you able to hold, or would you prefer a callback?"

**If customer chooses to hold:**
- Put on hold
- Check back every 2-3 minutes: "Thank you for holding, I'm still waiting for a senior tech to become available."
- Update customer on any changes to wait time

**Option 2: Callback**

**Script:**

> "I can have a senior technician call you back within [TIME FRAME]. Would that work for you? I'll need a good callback number and a brief description to put in the queue."

**Collect:**
- Callback number (verify it's correct)
- Best time to call (if customer has preference)
- Brief issue description (for Level 2 queue)

**Create escalation ticket:**
- Log in escalation queue
- Priority level (emergency, urgent, standard)
- All information for Level 2

**Confirm with customer:**

> "Perfect. A senior technician will call you at [NUMBER] within [TIME FRAME]. Your ticket number is [TICKET]. Is there anything else I can help you with while we wait for that callback?"

---

### Scenario C: Level 2 Unavailable (After Hours, Holidays)

**If calling outside business hours:**

**Check Level 2 availability:**
- Emergency line (121.7 MHz): 24/7 for life-threatening emergencies
- After-hours on-call: Available for urgent (not routine) issues
- Standard escalations: Next business day

**If Emergency (life-threatening):**

**Script:**

> "[CUSTOMER NAME], this is a life-threatening emergency. I'm connecting you to our emergency response line immediately. Stay on the line."

**Transfer to emergency coordinator (24/7 line)**

**If Urgent (not life-threatening but time-sensitive):**

**Script:**

> "I understand this is urgent. Our senior technician on-call is available for urgent issues outside business hours. Let me see if I can reach them."

**Contact on-call Level 2:**
- Page/call on-call technician
- Brief them on situation
- Determine if they'll take call now or callback

**If Standard (can wait until business hours):**

**Script:**

> "Our Level 2 technicians are available during business hours, [HOURS], [DAYS]. I can schedule a callback for you first thing [NEXT BUSINESS DAY] morning. In the meantime, here's what we can do..."

**Provide interim solutions:**
- Temporary workarounds (if safe)
- Emergency supplies to buy time (emergency O₂, backup power, etc.)
- Ensure customer safe until callback

---

### Scenario D: Issue Resolves Before Transfer Complete

**Sometimes, while briefing Level 2 or waiting for transfer, issue resolves:**

**Example:** Customer says "Oh wait, it's working now!"

**Script:**

> "That's great! Let me verify with you quickly that it's fully functional..."

**Quick verification:**
- Confirm system working normally
- Ask what changed (did customer do something while on hold?)
- Verify no errors or warnings

**If truly resolved:**

> "Excellent. It sounds like the issue has resolved. I'm going to cancel the escalation, but if the problem returns, please call us back and reference ticket [NUMBER]. We'll have all your information on file."

**Update call log:**
- Note issue resolved before escalation completed
- Document what resolved it (if known)
- Mark as resolved, no escalation needed

**Inform Level 2 (if already contacted):**
- "Thanks Sarah, customer's issue resolved while we were setting up the transfer. I'll close it out. Thanks for being available."

---

### Scenario E: Level 2 Declines Escalation (Sends Back to You)

**Occasionally, Level 2 may determine issue doesn't require escalation:**

**Level 2 says:** "This is a standard fuel filter issue, it's in KB-062. You can handle this one."

**Graceful handling:**

> "Got it, thanks. I'll work through KB-062 with them."

**Return to customer:**

> "[CUSTOMER NAME], thank you for holding. I've consulted with our senior technician and they've confirmed the best next step is [TROUBLESHOOTING STEP]. Let me walk you through that..."

**Don't:**
- Tell customer "They didn't want to help you" (unprofessional)
- Express frustration to customer
- Blindly refuse to help (you tried to escalate, now do the work)

**Do:**
- Use Level 2's guidance to help customer
- Learn from it (why didn't you find KB-062 earlier? Improve for next time)

## Escalation Reasons - Examples

### Good Escalation Reasons (Level 2 Will Accept)

**Example 1:**
> "Customer's reactor showing intermittent power drops. We've checked fuel (OK), coolant (OK), magnetic containment (OK), and ran diagnostics (all green). No errors, but power continues dropping every 10-15 minutes. I think it needs advanced diagnostics beyond my scope."

**Why good:** Thorough troubleshooting completed, issue persists, requires expertise

**Example 2:**
> "Customer has nav computer with custom military modifications. I'm not familiar with the modified firmware and KB articles don't cover it. Customer asking about compatibility with new subspace array."

**Why good:** Specialized knowledge required, outside standard documentation

**Example 3:**
> "Customer's FTL drive failed during jump, they manually completed the jump (successfully). Now they want to know if FTL drive safe to use again or needs inspection. I'm not qualified to assess structural integrity after manual jump."

**Why good:** Safety-critical decision, requires expert judgment

**Example 4:**
> "Customer followed KB-045 for low thrust (cleaned injectors, checked fuel, verified coils). Thrust improved from 60% to 75% but still not 100%. We're stuck at step 12 of KB article which says 'if still degraded after all steps, escalate.'"

**Why good:** KB article instructs escalation, customer completed all steps

### Poor Escalation Reasons (Level 2 Will Send Back)

**Example 1:**
> "Customer says reactor won't start. I didn't check if the panel has power yet."

**Why poor:** Basic troubleshooting not completed, waste of Level 2 time

**Example 2:**
> "Customer complaining about low oxygen, I don't know what to do."

**Why poor:** This is KB-027, basic Level 1 issue, you should handle it

**Example 3:**
> "Customer is angry and yelling at me. I want to transfer them."

**Why poor:** Customer emotion alone isn't escalation reason (unless combined with technical complexity)

**Example 4:**
> "This is taking a long time and my shift ends in 20 minutes."

**Why poor:** Your schedule isn't a reason to escalate, customer should not be impacted by shift changes

## De-Escalation Techniques (Try Before Escalating)

**Before escalating due to customer frustration, try these techniques:**

### Technique 1: Empathy and Acknowledgment

**Script:**

> "I understand this is frustrating. Being stranded with a broken [SYSTEM] is stressful. Let me make sure we get this resolved for you."

**Why it works:** Customer feels heard, reduces emotional temperature

### Technique 2: Set Clear Expectations

**Script:**

> "Here's what we're going to do next: I'll walk you through three quick checks. This should take about 10 minutes. If those don't resolve it, we'll escalate to a senior technician. Does that sound reasonable?"

**Why it works:** Customer knows plan, knows timeframe, feels some control

### Technique 3: Explain Your Actions

**Script:**

> "I'm checking our database for your ship model to see if there are any known issues with this system... Okay, I found a technical bulletin that might apply. Let me pull that up..."

**Why it works:** Customer knows you're actively working, not just randomly troubleshooting

### Technique 4: Small Wins

**Script:**

> "Okay, we've ruled out the fuel system - that's actually good news, means it's not a tank leak. Now let's check the injectors..."

**Why it works:** Frames troubleshooting as progress, not failure

### Technique 5: Partnership Language

**Use:** "Let's...", "We're going to...", "Together we'll..."

**Avoid:** "You need to...", "Do this...", "Check that..."

**Why it works:** Creates sense of teamwork, not you giving orders

## Quality Standards for Escalations

**Good escalations:**
- Complete information provided to Level 2
- Customer informed and agrees
- Warm handoff (not blind transfer)
- Documented thoroughly
- Necessary (not avoidable with better Level 1 work)

**Poor escalations:**
- Blind transfer (customer has to repeat everything)
- Insufficient troubleshooting before escalating
- Missing information (Level 2 has to ask basic questions)
- Not documented
- Avoidable (should have been handled at Level 1)

**Escalation Rate Targets:**
- **Individual rep:** 15-25% of calls escalated (guideline)
- <10%: May indicate not escalating when should (or only taking easy calls)
- >35%: May indicate insufficient Level 1 troubleshooting
- Evaluate quality, not just quantity (good escalations acceptable even if higher rate)

## After Escalation - Follow-Up

**If customer had significant issue, consider follow-up:**

**Next day, send message or call:**

> "Hi [CUSTOMER NAME], this is [YOUR NAME] from ORSM Support. I escalated your [ISSUE] to our senior technician yesterday. I wanted to follow up and see if the issue was resolved and if there's anything else we can do for you."

**Why:**
- Shows you care
- Gets feedback on Level 2's performance
- Opportunity to learn (what did Level 2 do that you didn't?)
- Builds customer loyalty

**Not required for every escalation, but good practice for:**
- Major issues
- Frustrated customers
- Long-term/repeat customers

## Learning from Escalations

**After each escalation, ask yourself:**

1. **Could I have resolved this at Level 1?**
   - If yes: What knowledge/skill did I lack? How can I learn it?
   - If no: Escalation was appropriate

2. **What did Level 2 do differently?**
   - Request feedback from Level 2 if possible
   - Review resolution notes in ticket system
   - Learn for next time

3. **Was escalation smooth?**
   - Did customer have good experience?
   - Was information complete?
   - What could I improve?

**Track your escalations:**
- Which types of issues do you escalate most?
- Are there patterns (e.g., always escalate reactor issues)?
- Target those for additional training

**Goal:** Reduce avoidable escalations over time through learning, while maintaining good escalations when truly needed.

**Remember:** Escalation is not failure. It's recognition that customer needs expertise beyond your scope. The goal is to get customer the RIGHT help, whether that's you (Level 1) or senior tech (Level 2). Escalate when appropriate, but also develop your skills to handle more issues over time.

**Questions?** Ask your supervisor or a Level 2 tech for guidance. They want to help you succeed.
