# Preventive Maintenance Guide

**Document Type:** Maintenance Procedures
**Audience:** Ship Engineers, Maintenance Technicians, Owners
**Last Updated:** 2847.09.14

## Purpose

Preventive maintenance prevents breakdowns, extends equipment life, and ensures safety. This guide provides comprehensive maintenance schedules and procedures for all major ship systems. Following this schedule reduces emergency repairs by 60-80% and extends component life by 30-50%.

## Philosophy of Preventive Maintenance

**Preventive vs. Reactive:**
- **Preventive:** Scheduled maintenance before failure (planned, controlled cost)
- **Reactive:** Repair after failure (unplanned, expensive, dangerous)

**Cost-Benefit:**
- Preventive costs: Time, parts, labor (predictable)
- Reactive costs: Emergency service, towing, cargo delays, potential damage (unpredictable, often 5-10x preventive)

**Example:**
- Replace fuel injectors preventively (1,000 credits, 2 hours) every 18 months
- OR wait until clogged: Engine fails mid-flight, stranded, towing (2,000 credits), emergency repair (3,000 credits), cargo delay penalties (5,000+ credits)
- **Preventive maintenance pays for itself**

## Cost-Benefit Analysis: Preventive Maintenance

**Annual Preventive Maintenance Costs (Medium Freighter):**
- Daily checks: Free (crew time only)
- Weekly checks: ~500 credits/year (parts)
- Monthly checks: ~3,000 credits/year (parts)
- Quarterly checks: ~5,000 credits/year (parts)
- Annual overhaul: ~45,000 credits
- **Total:** ~55,000 credits/year

**Vs. Reactive Maintenance (Estimated):**
- 2-3 major failures per year: 10,000-30,000 credits each = 30,000-90,000 credits
- Emergency service calls: 5-10 calls = 15,000-30,000 credits
- Towing/rescue: 1-2 times = 5,000-15,000 credits
- Cargo delays/penalties: Variable (can be massive)
- Premature component replacement (vs. extending life): 10,000-20,000 credits
- **Total:** ~100,000-200,000 credits/year (plus downtime, stress, risk)

**Savings:** 50,000-150,000 credits/year by doing preventive maintenance
**ROI:** 2-4x return on preventive maintenance investment

**Intangible Benefits:**
- Safety (fewer catastrophic failures)
- Reliability (less downtime)
- Peace of mind
- Longer ship life (may operate 30-40 years instead of 15-20)
- Higher resale value (well-maintained ships command premium)

---

## Deferred Maintenance: Risks and Consequences

**"I'll do it later..." is dangerous and expensive.**

**Example Cascade Failure:**
1. Skip HEPA filter replacement (save 80 credits, 10 minutes)
2. APU works harder (clogged filter restricts airflow)
3. APU motor overheats from overwork
4. Motor burns out (1,800 credit replacement, 4 hours labor)
5. While waiting for part (3 days), crew uses emergency O₂ (500 credits)
6. **Result:** Saved 80 credits, spent 2,300 credits + 3 days delay

**Deferred maintenance compounds:**
- One skipped maintenance → System works harder → Wears faster → Premature failure → More expensive repair → More downtime
- "I'll skip this month" becomes "I'll skip this quarter" becomes catastrophic failure

**Red Flags:**
- Multiple deferred items on maintenance checklist
- "We'll do it at the next port" (but never do)
- Ignoring yellow warnings on panels ("It still works...")
- Running out of spare parts, not reordering

**If you're behind on maintenance:**
1. Prioritize safety items (life support, propulsion, hull integrity)
2. Create catch-up plan (spread over 2-3 months if needed)
3. Get professional help if overwhelmed
4. Commit to staying current going forward

---

## Conclusion

**Maintenance is not optional.**

Well-maintained ship:
- Safe
- Reliable
- Economical
- Long-lived

Poorly-maintained ship:
- Dangerous
- Breaks down frequently
- Expensive (emergency repairs)
- Short-lived

**Investment in maintenance = Investment in ship, crew, and mission success.**
